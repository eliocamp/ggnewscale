  abstract = {The ever-increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, primarily due to the frequent use and misuse of antibiotics, is an issue of serious global concern. Migratory birds have a significant role in dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), as they acquire resistant bacteria from reservoirs and transport them to other environments which are relatively less influenced by anthropogenically. We have investigated the prevalence of ARB in a long-distance migratory bird, the Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) captured from the Svalbard Archipelago. The birds were tagged with geolocators to track their extraordinary long migration, and the cloacal samples were collected before the migration and after the migration by recapturing the same birds. The tracking of 12 birds revealed that during the annual cycle they underwent a total of 166 stopovers (11–18, mean\,=\,3.8) and recovery points along the Atlantic coast. Twelve major bacterial genera were identified from Arctic tern cloacal samples, which are dominated by Staphylococcus spp. and Aerococcus spp. The bacterial isolates showed resistance against 16 antibiotics (before migration) and 17 antibiotics (after migration) out of 17 antibiotics tested. Resistance to β-lactam and quinolone class of antibiotics were frequent among the bacteria. The study highlights the potential role of Arctic tern in the dissemination of multidrug resistant bacteria across far and wide destinations, especially to the polar environments.},

  abstract = {Warming-induced permafrost thaw could enhance microbial decomposition of previously stored soil organic matter (SOM) to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. The environmental parameters regulating microbe-organic matter interactions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in permafrost peatlands are however still largely unknown. The objective of this work is to understand controls on SOM degradation and its impact on GHG emissions across the Stordalen Mire, a thawing peat plateau in Northern Sweden. Here, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize SOM molecular composition in peat soil samples from the active layers of a Sphagnum-dominated bog and rich fen sites in the Mire. Microbe-organic matter interactions and GHG emissions across the thaw gradient were controlled by aboveground vegetation and soil pH. An increasingly high abundance of reduced organic compounds experiencing greater humification rates due to enhanced microbial activity were observed with increasing thaw, in parallel with higher CH4 and CO2 emissions. Bog SOM however contained more Sphagnum-derived phenolics, simple carbohydrates, and organic- acids. The low degradation of bog SOM by microbial communities, the enhanced SOM transformation by potentially abiotic mechanisms, and the accumulation of simple carbohydrates in the bog sites could be attributed in part to the low pH conditions of the system associated with Sphagnum mosses. We show that Gibbs free energy of C half reactions based on C oxidation state for OM can be used as a quantifiable measure for OM decomposability and quality to enhance current biogeochemical models to predict C decomposition rates. We found a direct association between OM chemical diversity and δ13C-CH4 in peat porewater; where higher substrate diversity was positively correlated with enriched δ13C-CH4 in fen sites. Oxidized sulfur-containing compounds, produced by Sphagnum, were further hypothesized to control GHG emissions by acting as electron acceptors for a sulfate-reducing electron transport chain, inhibiting methanogenesis in peat bogs. These results suggest that warming-induced permafrost thaw might increase organic matter lability, in subset of sites that become wetlands, and shift biogeochemical processes toward faster decomposition with an increasing proportion of Creleased as CH4.},

  abstract = {Metabolites can mediate species interactions and the assembly of microbial communities. However, how these chemicals relate to the assembly processes and co-occurrence patterns of diazotrophic assemblages in root-associated soils remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the diversity and assembly of diazotrophic communities and further deciphered their links with metabolites on Tibetan Plateau. We found that the distribution of sugars and organic acids in the root-associated soils was significantly correlated with the richness of diazotrophs. The presence of these two soil metabolites explains the variability in diazotrophic community compositions. The differential concentrations of these metabolites were significantly linked with the distinctive abundances of diazotrophic taxa in same land types dominated by different plants or dissimilar soils by same plants. The assembly of diazotrophic communities is subject to deterministic ecological processes, which are widely modulated by the variety and amount of sugars and organic acids. Organic acids, for instance, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid and citric acid, were effective predictors of the characteristics of diazotrophic assemblages across desert habitats. Diazotrophic co-occurrence networks tended to be more complex and connected within different land types covered by the same plant species. The concentrations of multiple sugars and organic acids were coupled significantly with the distribution of keystone species, such as Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Bradyrhizobium, and Mesorhizobium, in the co-occurrence network. These findings provide new insights into the assembly mechanisms of root-associated diazotrophic communities across the desert ecosystems of the Tibetan Plateau.},

  abstract = {Novel pathogen introduction can have drastic consequences for naive host populations, and outcomes can be difficult to predict. Evolutionary rescue (ER) provides a foundation for understanding whether hosts are driven to extinction or survive via adaptation. Currently, patterns of host population dynamics alongside evidence of adaptation are used to infer ER. However, the gap between established ER theory and complexity inherent in natural systems makes interpreting empirical patterns difficult because they can be confounded with ecological drivers of survival under current theory. To bridge this gap, we expand ER theory to include biological selective agents, such as pathogens. We find birth processes to be more important than previously theorised in determining ER potential. We employ a novel framework evaluating ER potential within natural systems and gain ability to identify system characteristics that make ER possible. Identifying these characteristics allows a shift from retrospective observation to a predictive mindset, and our findings suggest that ER occurrence may be more limited than previously thought. We use the plague system of Yersinia pestis infecting Cynomys ludovicianus (black-tailed prairie dogs) and Spermophilus beecheyi (California ground squirrels) as a case study.},

Controls viewed stimuli either in one visual field (restricting initial processing to one hemisphere) or, like the patients, in central vision. Across word and face tasks, patients performed comparably to controls using primarily one hemisphere, but more poorly than controls viewing stimuli centrally with both hemispheres engaged. Additionally, patients showed deficits in low-level visual processing that may explain their word/face recognition deficits relative to controls.

  abstract = {The rhizosphere, a narrow zone of soil near plant roots, is a hot spot for microbial activity. Rhizosphere microbiota directly or indirectly benefit plants by supplementing nutrients, producing beneficial chemicals, or suppressing pathogens. Plants attract and modulate bacteria within the rhizosphere by releasing exudates. Plants also tend to select the rhizosphere microbiota based on their needs; a phenomenon termed as “rhizosphere effect”. In this study, we characterized the rhizosphere microbiota of peanut plants across the crop development cycle from pre-sowing of seeds to post-harvest of crop under field conditions. The rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from different crop developmental stages were also compared. The composition of bulk soil microbiota resembled microbiota of pre-sowing and post-harvest soil and was markedly different from rhizosphere soil samples. Rhizosphere samples were enriched with multiple organisms mostly from the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidota phyla. Differences in diversity were observed among the rhizosphere samples but not in bulk soil across different crop development stages. Pseudomonas\_M indica was highly enriched during the germination of seeds. Furthermore, Plant Growth Promoting (PGP) bacteria like Bacillus were enriched during the middle stages of crop development but there was a decline in PGP organisms in the matured crop stage. We also observed a significant association of pH and Electrical Conductivity (EC) with the profiles of microbial community. Overall, this study portrayed the changes in rhizosphere microbiota of peanut during different developmental stages of crop and may help to design stage specific bio-strategies such as bio-fertilizer to improve crop yield.},

HEV was detected in rabbits from all states and territories, except the Northern Territory. Seroprevalence varied between locations (from 0\% to 22\%), demonstrating that HEV is widely distributed in rabbit populations across Australia. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Australian HEV sequences are genetically diverse and that HEV was likely introduced into Australia independently on several occasions. In summary, this study broadens our understanding of the genetic diversity of rabbit HEV globally and shows that the virus is endemic in both domestic and wild rabbit populations in Australia.},

Distributed across the Rolwaling Himal valley in Nepal between 3700 and 5100 m a.s.l. at eight automated weather stations (AWSs), meteorological data between October 2017 and September 2018 were examined. VWDs were classified by means of ERA5 reanalysis data and in situ observations, employing established thresholds using precipitation, solar radiation, air pressure, and wind speed data at different pressure levels. Thus, overlying synoptic influences are highly reduced and distinctive diurnal patterns emerge. A strong seasonal component in near-surface wind speed and wind direction patterns was detected. Further analyses showed the diurnal characteristics of slow (approximately 0.5–0.9 m s−1), but gradually increasing wind speeds over the night, transitional periods in the morning and evening, and the highest averaged wind speeds of approximately 4.3 m s−1 around noon during the VWDs. Wind directions followed a 180∘ shift with nocturnal katabatic mountain winds and inflowing anabatic valley winds during the daytime. With AWSs at opposing hillsides, slope winds were clearly identifiable and thermally driven spatio-temporal variations throughout the valley were revealed. Consequently, varying temporal shifts in wind speed and direction along the valley bottom can be extracted. In general, the data follow the well-known schematic of diurnal mountain–valley wind systems, but emphasize the influence of monsoonal seasonality and the surrounding complex mountain topography as decisive factors.},

We performed a genomic epidemiology investigation of blaNDM-producing CRE to understand their regional emergence and spread.We performed whole-genome sequencing on NDM+ CRE isolates from four point-prevalence surveys across 35 facilities (LTACHs, vSNFs, and acute care hospital medical intensive care units) in the Chicago area and investigated the genomic relatedness and transmission dynamics of these isolates over time.Genomic analyses revealed that the rise of NDM+ CRE was due to the clonal dissemination of an ST147 Klebsiella pneumoniae strain harboring blaNDM-1 on an IncF plasmid. Dated phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that ST147 was introduced into the region around 2013 and likely acquired NDM around 2015. Analyzing the relatedness of strains within and between facilities supported initial increases in prevalence due to intra-facility transmission in certain vSNFs, with evidence of subsequent inter-facility spread among LTACHs and vSNFs connected by patient transfer.We identified a regional outbreak of blaNDM-1 ST147 that began in and disseminated across Chicago area post-acute care facilities.

  abstract = {Germinal centers play a key role in the adaptive immune system since they are able to produce memory B cells and plasma cells that produce high affinity antibodies for an effective immune protection. The mechanisms underlying cell-fate decisions are not well understood but asymmetric division of antigen, B-cell receptor affinity, interactions between B-cells and T follicular helper cells (triggering CD40 signaling), and regulatory interactions of transcription factors have all been proposed to play a role. In addition, a temporal switch from memory B-cell to plasma cell differentiation during the germinal center reaction has been shown. To investigate if antigen affinity-based Tfh cell help recapitulates the temporal switch we implemented a multiscale model that integrates cellular interactions with a core gene regulatory network comprising BCL6, IRF4, and BLIMP1. Using this model we show that affinity-based CD40 signaling in combination with asymmetric division of B-cells result in switch from memory B-cell to plasma cell generation during the course of the germinal center reaction. We also show that cell fate division is unlikely to be (solely) based on asymmetric division of Ag but that BLIMP1 is a more important factor.

  abstract = {Hydroclimatic time series analysis focuses on a few feature types (e.g., autocorrelations, trends, extremes), which describe a small portion of the entire information content of the observations. Aiming to exploit a larger part of the available information and, thus, to deliver more reliable results (e.g., in hydroclimatic time series clustering contexts), here we approach hydroclimatic time series analysis differently, i.e., by performing massive feature extraction. In this respect, we develop a big data framework for hydroclimatic variable behaviour characterization. This framework relies on approximately 60 diverse features and is completely automatic (in the sense that it does not depend on the hydroclimatic process at hand). We apply the new framework to characterize mean monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and mean monthly river flow. The applications are conducted at the global scale by exploiting 40-year-long time series originating from over 13 000 stations. We extract interpretable knowledge on seasonality, trends, autocorrelation, long-range dependence and entropy, and on feature types that are met less frequently. We further compare the examined hydroclimatic variable types in terms of this knowledge and, identify patterns related to the spatial variability of the features. For this latter purpose, we also propose and exploit a hydroclimatic time series clustering methodology. This new methodology is based on Breiman's random forests. The descriptive and exploratory insights gained by the global-scale applications prove the usefulness of the adopted feature compilation in hydroclimatic contexts. Moreover, the spatially coherent patterns characterizing the clusters delivered by the new methodology build confidence in its future exploitation. Given this spatial coherence and the scale-independent nature of the delivered feature values (which makes them particularly useful in forecasting and simulation contexts), we believe that this methodology could also be beneficial within regionalization frameworks, in which knowledge on hydrological similarity is exploited in technical and operative terms.},

  abstract = {The widely spread evolutionary strategy of parental care is considered an important driver of social evolution. Although offspring were long thought to primarily interact competitively, recent studies revealed the potential importance of sibling cooperation. Theories suggest that the degree of cooperation in offspring interactions depends on the degree of offspring dependence on parental care: offspring unable to forage on their own should compete more, whereas more independent juveniles may increase the degree of cooperation. In this study, we tested the occurrence of sibling cooperation in the absence of posthatching care in several burying beetle species exhibiting varying degrees of offspring dependence. To this end, we measured larval growth rate and survival in the presence and absence of prehatching care using different brood sizes. We found that sibling cooperation cannot be exclusively explained by offspring dependence on parental care. Although only species with more independent larvae cooperated when receiving prehatching care, larval cooperation occurred across species in the absence of care. The latter result suggests that sibling cooperation was already present in an early ancestor of the genus Nicrophorus. Overall, these findings give important insights into the transition from facultative to obligate family life.},

  abstract = {In a companion paper, Sikorska-Senoner and Quilty (2021) introduced the ensemble-based conceptual-data-driven approach (CDDA) for improving hydrological simulations. This approach consists of an ensemble of hydrological model (HM) simulations (generated via different parameter sets) whose residuals are ‘corrected’ by a data-driven model (one per HM parameter set), resulting in an improved ensemble simulation. Through a case study involving three Swiss catchments, it was demonstrated that CDDA generates significantly improved ensemble streamflow simulations when compared to the ensemble HM. In this follow-up study, a stochastic version of CDDA (SCDDA) is developed that, in addition to parameter uncertainty, accounts for input data, input variable selection, and model output uncertainty. Using several deterministic and probabilistic performance metrics, it is shown that SCDDA results in significantly more accurate and reliable ensemble-based streamflow simulations than the CDDA, ensemble and stochastic HMs, and a quantile regression-based approach, improving the mean interval score by 26–79\%.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamic metabolic flux analysis (TMFA) can narrow down the space of steady-state flux distributions, but requires knowledge of the standard Gibbs free energy for the modelled reactions. The latter are often not available due to unknown Gibbs free energy change of formation \$\$, \{\textbackslash Delta \}\_\{f\} G\^\{0\}\$\$, of metabolites. To optimize the usage of data on thermodynamics in constraining a model, reaction lumping has been proposed to eliminate metabolites with unknown \$\$\{\textbackslash Delta \}\_\{f\} G\^\{0\}\$\$. However, the lumping procedure has not been formalized nor implemented for systematic identification of lumped reactions. Here, we propose, implement, and test a combined procedure for reaction lumping, applicable to genome-scale metabolic models. It is based on identification of groups of metabolites with unknown \$\$\{\textbackslash Delta \}\_\{f\} G\^\{0\}\$\$whose elimination can be conducted independently of the others via: (1) group implementation, aiming to eliminate an entire such group, and, if this is infeasible, (2) a sequential implementation to ensure that a maximal number of metabolites with unknown \$\$\{\textbackslash Delta \}\_\{f\} G\^\{0\}\$\$are eliminated. Our comparative analysis with genome-scale metabolic models of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Homo sapiens shows that the combined procedure provides an efficient means for systematic identification of lumped reactions. We also demonstrate that TMFA applied to models with reactions lumped according to the proposed procedure lead to more precise predictions in comparison to the original models. The provided implementation thus ensures the reproducibility of the findings and their application with standard TMFA.},

  abstract = {Forecasts of increased frequency of meteorological extremes have received considerable attention due to their potential impact on the integrity of biotic communities, stability of terrestrial and aquatic environments, availability of ecosystem services, and broader societal prosperity. Canada is projected to experience greater warming rates than many other regions of the world and changes in meteorological extremes are predicted to be variable across the country. In this context, our goal is to evaluate the long-term trends of extreme meteorological variables (air and dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) in southern and central Ontario (from 42°N to 50°N), while considering the role dynamics of large-scale atmospheric oscillations (El Niño–Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Air temperature minima increased year-round, while temperature maxima mainly increased during the cooler months of the year. Consistent with recent evidence from the literature, our study identified an increase in the amount of atmospheric water since the 1950s, as shown by the rising trends in dew point temperature maxima and minima during winter and mid-summer/early-autumn, respectively. Likewise, we found a weak decline in the relative humidity during the warm season, and a more discernible declining trend during the cooler part of the year, which could be in turn reflective of the moderate change of temperature maxima and rising minima, respectively. Consistent with the broader evidence of a global terrestrial stilling, our analysis showed a declining occurrence of high wind-speed events across the entire study domain, and frequent slow-wind speeds during both warm and cold periods of the year. Interestingly, a closer examination of temporal trends in calm wind frequency provides evidence of a recent reversal in the latter trend with diminishing prevalence of very calm wind conditions. We generally found a weakly increasing temporal trend with maximum total daily precipitation, but without a coherent spatial pattern within the broader study area. Our analysis showed that large-scale phenomena have a discernible signature mostly on air temperature and humidity variables, but had little impact on low relative humidity, high and low wind-speed, and precipitation variability. Given the modest impact of teleconnections on long-term temporal trends, our study concludes that the meteorological extremes are more directly influenced by regional and local heat and humidity balance processes rather than global-scale atmospheric mechanisms. The observed trends of air temperature, humidity, and wind speed extremes suggest a profound impact on the phenology of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and human experience of weather.},

We hypothesize that peptide vaccines containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell stimulation would drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity, potentially avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we propose a set of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies and clinical trials.,},

We defined infections as CO, HO, or HACO epidemiologically. We integrated genomic, community exposure, and statewide hospital discharge data to infer MRSA origin.Among 1020 individuals with available WGS, most were USA300 wound infections (580 CO, 143 HO, 297 HACO). USA300 HO, CO, and HACO infections were intermixed on the USA300 phylogeny consistent with common strains circulating across community and healthcare settings. Community exposures (e.g. substance abuse, incarceration, homelessness) were associated with HACO and HO infections, and genetically-linked individuals from both groups had little overlap in healthcare facilities, supporting community origins. Most repeat infections—over months-to-years—occurred in individuals persistently carrying their own strains. These individuals were more likely to have genetic linkages, suggesting a role of persistent colonization in transmission.Efforts to reduce presumed nosocomial USA300 spread may require understanding and controlling community sources and transmission networks, particularly for repeat infections.}

  abstract = {Beneficial microorganisms shape the evolutionary trajectories of their hosts, facilitating or constraining the colonization of new ecological niches. One convincing example entails the responses of insect-microbe associations to rising temperatures. Indeed, the insect resilience to stressful high temperatures depends on the genetic identity of the obligate symbiont and the presence of heat protective facultative symbionts. With accumulating empirical evidence, there is a need of integrative studies to draw general patterns about the thermal sensitivity of insect-microbe associations, from an eco-evolutionary perspective. Focusing on aphid-bacteria mutualisms, this meta-analysis aims to quantify the context-dependent impacts of symbionts on host phenotype in benign or stressful heat conditions, across fitness traits, types of heat stress, and symbiont species. We found that warming lowered the benefits (parasitoid resistance) and costs (development, fecundity) of infection by facultative symbionts, which was overall mostly beneficial to the aphids under short-term heat stress (heat shock) rather than extended warming. Heat tolerant genotypes of the obligate symbiont Buchnera aphidicola and some facultative symbionts (Rickettsia sp., Serratia symbiotica) improved or maintained aphid fitness under heat stress. As phytophagous insects are central to terrestrial ecosystems, symbiont-mediated responses to increasing mean temperatures and frequency of heat waves in the context of climate change are key elements that may have cascading effects on food webs and there is an urgent need to continue accumulating data on other models. We discuss the implications of these conclusions for the general understanding of the cost-benefits balance and eco-evolutionary dynamics of insect-microbe associations faced with climate change.},

Regulation of Hsp90β is critical to coordinate its tasks and is mediated by several post-translational modifications. Here, we focus on two phosphorylation sites located in the charged linker region of human Hsp90β, Ser226 and Ser255, which have been frequently reported but whose function remains unclear. Targeted measurements by mass spectrometry indicated that intracellular Hsp90β is highly phosphorylated on both sites (\&gt;90\%). The level of phosphorylation was unaffected by various stresses (e.g., heat shock, inhibition with drugs) that impact Hsp90β activity. Mutating the two serines to alanines increased the amount of proteins interacting with Hsp90β globally and increased the sensitivity to tryptic cleavage in the C-terminal domain. Further investigation revealed that phosphorylation on Ser255 and to a lesser extent on Ser226 is decreased in the conditioned medium of cultured K562 cells, and that a non-phosphorylatable double alanine mutant was secreted more efficiently than the wild type. Overall, our results show that phosphorylation events in the charged linker regulate both the interactions of Hsp90β and its secretion, through changes in the conformation of the chaperone.},

  abstract = {COVID-19-induced ‘acute respiratory distress syndrome’ (ARDS) is associated with prolonged respiratory failure and high mortality, but the mechanistic basis of lung injury remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed pulmonary immune responses and lung pathology in two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 ARDS using functional single cell genomics, immunohistology and electron microscopy. We describe an accumulation of CD163-expressing monocyte-derived macrophages that acquired a profibrotic transcriptional phenotype during COVID-19 ARDS. Gene set enrichment and computational data integration revealed a significant similarity between COVID-19-associated macrophages and profibrotic macrophage populations identified in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. COVID-19 ARDS was associated with clinical, radiographic, histopathological, and ultrastructural hallmarks of pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure of human monocytes to SARS-CoV-2, but not Influenza A virus or viral RNA analogs, was sufficient to induce a similar profibrotic phenotype in vitro. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 triggers profibrotic macrophage responses and pronounced fibroproliferative ARDS.},

  abstract = {It is now indisputable that plastics are ubiquitous and problematic in ecosystems globally. Many suggestions have been made about the role that biofilms colonizing plastics in the environment—termed the “Plastisphere”—may play in the transportation and ecological impact of these plastics. By collecting and re-analyzing all raw 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metadata from 2,229 samples within 35 studies, we have performed the first meta-analysis of the Plastisphere in marine, freshwater, other aquatic (e.g., brackish or aquaculture) and terrestrial environments. We show that random forest models can be trained to differentiate between groupings of environmental factors as well as aspects of study design, but—crucially—also between plastics when compared with control biofilms and between different plastic types and community successional stages. Our meta-analysis confirms that potentially biodegrading Plastisphere members, the hydrocarbonoclastic Oceanospirillales and Alteromonadales are consistently more abundant in plastic than control biofilm samples across multiple studies and environments. This indicates the predilection of these organisms for plastics and confirms the urgent need for their ability to biodegrade plastics to be comprehensively tested. We also identified key knowledge gaps that should be addressed by future studies.},

  abstract = {Ontogenetic niche shifts, the phenomenon whereby animals change their resource use with growth, were probably widespread in dinosaurs, but most studies of duck-billed dinosaur ontogeny have so far focused mainly on the development of the cranial ornamentation. Here, we quantify allometry of 13 ecomorphological variables of the skull and examine tooth microwear in a sample of North American hadrosaurids to better understand their ecological functioning with growth. Our results indicate that, consistent with the Jarman-Bell principle relating body size to fibre intake and feeding selectivity, juvenile hadrosaurids were relatively more selective than their adult counterparts and subsisted on softer, low-growing browse cropped using lateral rotations of the neck. Chewing movements of the jaw probably did not differ greatly between growth stages. Our findings invite further investigation relating to cranial ontogenetic allometry in hadrosauromorphs more broadly, and to the possible role of ontogenetic niche shifts in the size structuring of Late Cretaceous herbivore communities.},

The mucosal–luminal interface has been established as a viable sample type for profiling the microbial biogeography of the gastrointestinal tract. We have developed a protocol to extract nucleic acids from viruses at the mucosal–luminal interface of the proximal and distal colon. Colonic viromes from pediatric patients with Crohn's disease demonstrated high interpatient diversity and low but significant intrapatient variation between sites. Whole metagenomics was also performed to explore virome–bacteriome interactions and to compare the viral communities observed in virome and whole metagenomic sequencing. A site-specific study of the human gut virome is a necessary step to advance our understanding of virome–bacteriome–host interactions in human diseases.},

  abstract = {Sacred natural sites (SNS) have gained recognition from conservationists, and are regarded as the oldest form of habitat protection in human history. Many case studies and literature reviews have been published on the subject. However, an updated and global-level synthesis on the effect of SNS on biodiversity conservation is still lacking. Here, we provide the first systematic review on SNS and biodiversity conservation, aiming to evaluate the effect of SNS across different: (i) continents; (ii) taxa; (iii) metrics. We checked 2750 papers and by applying inclusion criteria we selected 27 relevant papers. From these, we extracted descriptive data and 131 comparisons between SNS and Reference Sites. We applied vote-counting, multinomial and binomial post-hoc tests to the 131 comparisons. We found strong evidence that SNS have a positive effect on biodiversity, but also strong geographical and taxonomical biases, with most research focusing on Asia and Africa and on plants. We found that SNS have mainly positive effects on taxonomical diversity, vegetation structure and cultural uses of biodiversity. Our results strongly support the view that SNS have positive effects on biodiversity across continents and geographical settings, as found in a number of local studies and earlier overviews. These effects should be given official recognition in appropriate conservation frameworks, together with the specific forms of governance and management that characterize SNS. At the same time, further efforts are also required to fill the geographical and taxonomical gaps here highlighted, and to advancing our knowledge of SNS through more systematic research.},
