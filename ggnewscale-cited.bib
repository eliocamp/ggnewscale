  abstract = {The ever-increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, primarily due to the frequent use and misuse of antibiotics, is an issue of serious global concern. Migratory birds have a significant role in dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), as they acquire resistant bacteria from reservoirs and transport them to other environments which are relatively less influenced by anthropogenically. We have investigated the prevalence of ARB in a long-distance migratory bird, the Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) captured from the Svalbard Archipelago. The birds were tagged with geolocators to track their extraordinary long migration, and the cloacal samples were collected before the migration and after the migration by recapturing the same birds. The tracking of 12 birds revealed that during the annual cycle they underwent a total of 166 stopovers (11--18, mean\,=\,3.8) and recovery points along the Atlantic coast. Twelve major bacterial genera were identified from Arctic tern cloacal samples, which are dominated by Staphylococcus spp. and Aerococcus spp. The bacterial isolates showed resistance against 16 antibiotics (before migration) and 17 antibiotics (after migration) out of 17 antibiotics tested. Resistance to {$\beta$}-lactam and quinolone class of antibiotics were frequent among the bacteria. The study highlights the potential role of Arctic tern in the dissemination of multidrug resistant bacteria across far and wide destinations, especially to the polar environments.},

  abstract = {Warming-induced permafrost thaw could enhance microbial decomposition of previously stored soil organic matter (SOM) to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. The environmental parameters regulating microbe-organic matter interactions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in permafrost peatlands are however still largely unknown. The objective of this work is to understand controls on SOM degradation and its impact on GHG emissions across the Stordalen Mire, a thawing peat plateau in Northern Sweden. Here, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize SOM molecular composition in peat soil samples from the active layers of a Sphagnum-dominated bog and rich fen sites in the Mire. Microbe-organic matter interactions and GHG emissions across the thaw gradient were controlled by aboveground vegetation and soil pH. An increasingly high abundance of reduced organic compounds experiencing greater humification rates due to enhanced microbial activity were observed with increasing thaw, in parallel with higher CH4 and CO2 emissions. Bog SOM however contained more Sphagnum-derived phenolics, simple carbohydrates, and organic- acids. The low degradation of bog SOM by microbial communities, the enhanced SOM transformation by potentially abiotic mechanisms, and the accumulation of simple carbohydrates in the bog sites could be attributed in part to the low pH conditions of the system associated with Sphagnum mosses. We show that Gibbs free energy of C half reactions based on C oxidation state for OM can be used as a quantifiable measure for OM decomposability and quality to enhance current biogeochemical models to predict C decomposition rates. We found a direct association between OM chemical diversity and {$\delta$}13C-CH4 in peat porewater; where higher substrate diversity was positively correlated with enriched {$\delta$}13C-CH4 in fen sites. Oxidized sulfur-containing compounds, produced by Sphagnum, were further hypothesized to control GHG emissions by acting as electron acceptors for a sulfate-reducing electron transport chain, inhibiting methanogenesis in peat bogs. These results suggest that warming-induced permafrost thaw might increase organic matter lability, in subset of sites that become wetlands, and shift biogeochemical processes toward faster decomposition with an increasing proportion of Creleased as CH4.},

  abstract = {High-risk clone types in Pseudomonas aeruginosa are problematic global multidrug-resistant clones. However, apart from their ability to resist antimicrobial treatment, not much is known about what sets these clones apart from the multitude of other clones. In high-risk clone ST111, it has previously been shown that replacement of the native serotype biosynthetic gene cluster (O4) by a different gene cluster (O12) by horizontal gene transfer and recombination may have contributed to the global success of this clone. However, the extent to which isolates undergo this type of serotype switching has not been adequately explored in P. aeruginosa . In the present study, a bioinformatics tool has been developed and utilized to provide a first estimate of serotype switching in groups of multidrug resistant (MDR) clinical isolates. The tool detects serotype switching by analysis of core-genome phylogeny and in silico serotype. Analysis of a national survey of MDR isolates found a prevalence of 3.9{$\mkern1mu\%$} of serotype-switched isolates in high-risk clone types ST111, ST244 and ST253. A global survey of MDR isolates was additionally analysed, and it was found that 2.3{$\mkern1mu\%$} of isolates had undergone a serotype switch. To further understand this process, we determined the exact boundaries of the horizontally transferred serotype O12 island. We found that the size of the serotype island correlates with the clone type of the receiving isolate and additionally we found intra-clone type variations in size and boundaries. This suggests multiple serotype switch events. Moreover, we found that the housekeeping gene gyrA is co-transferred with the O12 serotype island, which prompted us to analyse this allele for all serotype O12 isolates. We found that 95{$\mkern1mu\%$} of ST111 O12 isolates had a resistant gyrA allele and 86{$\mkern1mu\%$} of all O12 isolates had a resistant gyrA allele. The rates of resistant gyrA alleles in isolates with other prevalent serotypes are all lower. Together, these results show that the transfer and acquisition of serotype O12 in high-risk clone ST111 has happened multiple times and may be facilitated by multiple donors, which clearly suggests a strong selection pressure for this process. However, gyrA-mediated antibiotic resistance may not be the only evolutionary driver.,}

We isolated both abundant and rare phycosphere members, representing 18.4\% of the source communities. Positive and neutral effects predominated over negative effects on host growth. The proportion of each effect type and whether the day of isolation mattered varied by host species. Bacteria affected algal carrying capacity more than growth rate, suggesting that nutrient remineralization and toxic byproduct metabolism may be a dominant mechanism. Across-host algal fitness assays indicated host-specific growth effects of our isolates. We observed no phylogenetic conservation of the effect on host growth among bacterial isolates. Even isolates with the same ASV had divergent effects on host growth. Our results emphasize highly specific host-bacterial interactions in the phycosphere and raise questions as to which mechanisms mediate these interactions.},

A single, fast-cycling ChFRIGIDA allele evolved adaptively allowing range expansion from glacial refugia, unlike Arabidopsis where multiple FRIGIDA haplotypes were involved. The Azores islands, where Arabidopsis is scarce, are a hotspot for C. hirsuta diversity. We identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in the heterochronic SPL9 transcription factor as a determinant of an Azorean morphotype. This QTL shows evidence for positive selection, and its distribution mirrors a climate gradient that broadly shaped the Azorean flora. Overall, we establish a framework to explore how the interplay of adaptation, demography, and development shaped diversity patterns of 2 related plant species.},

F. fomentarius sequences in the metagenomes were replaced by bacterial sequences as the fruiting body decomposed. Most CAZymes expressed in decomposing fruiting bodies targeted components of the fungal cell wall with almost all chitin-targeting sequences, plus a high proportion of beta-glucan-targeting sequences, belonging to Arthropoda. We suggest that decomposing fruiting bodies of F. fomentarius represent a habitat rich in bacteria, while its decomposition is primarily driven by Arthropoda. Decomposing fruiting bodies thus represent a specific habitat supporting both microorganisms and microfauna.},

Bumble bees host core and non-core microbiota which may contribute to increased lifetime fitness. The presence of Fructobacillus in the gut microbiomes of bumble bee workers, or the replacement of core symbionts with Fructobacillus bacteria, has been considered a marker of dysbiosis. A phylogenomic analysis and functional genomic characterization of the genomes of 21 Fructobacillus isolates from bumble bees demonstrated that they represented four species, i.e. Fructobacillus cardui, Fructobacillus fructosus, Fructobacillus tropaeoli, and the novel species Fructobacillus evanidus sp. Nov. Our results confirmed and substantiated the presence of two phylogenetically and functionally distinct Fructobacillus species clades that differ in genome size, percentage G\,+\,C content, the number of coding DNA sequences and metabolic characteristics. Clade 1 and clade 2 species differed in amino acid and, to a lesser extent, in carbohydrate metabolism, with F. evanidus and F. tropaeoli genomes featuring a higher number of complete metabolic pathways. While Fructobacillus genomes encoded genes that allow adhesion, biofilm formation, antibacterial activity and detoxification, other bacteria isolated from the bumble bee gut appeared better equipped to co-exist with the bumble bee host. The isolation and identification of multiple Fructobacillus species from several bumble bee gut samples in the present study also argued against a specific partnership between Fructobacillus species and their bumble bee hosts.},

Based on the resulting movement track, the individual covered a minimum distance of 712~km, traversing the exclusive economic zones of three different countries. Its track began in the United Arab Emirates, from where it headed north, entering Iranian waters, where it spent most of its time, before continuing westward across the Gulf and eventually reaching Qatari waters. Novel insights into its behaviour revealed an observation of rapid ascents over the study period. Although both diurnal and nocturnal ascents were observed, they occurred predominantly during nocturnal periods. Contrary to the prevailing belief that wedgefish are bottom-associated, the study animal spent a considerable amount of time in the water column. The use of various depths in both nearshore and offshore waters highlights elevated susceptibility to multiple types of fishing gear. This underscores the need for an international cooperative approach to the management and conservation of shark-like rays in the Arabian Gulf.},

  abstract = {Grazing birds like geese can have a big impact on agricultural land, potentially causing damage to crops. Their exploitation of agricultural land varies within and between seasons, and these temporal grazing patterns can be influenced by management. Furthermore, management practices using scaring and accommodation aim to influence local grazing pressures. To achieve efficient goose management we need a good understanding of the effects of timing and intensity of grazing on grass development and subsequent yield loss. We performed an exclosure study on twelve fields in Friesland (Frysl{\^a}n), the Netherlands to study the effect of grazing on grass development and potential yield loss. Grazing was prevented either from November or from early April until farmers anticipated their first harvest. Every two weeks we measured grass height and calculated growth in exclosures and in ungrazed plots, and performed dropping counts. The results show that the difference in grass height between grazed and ungrazed plots increases with grazing pressure, but less so for higher grazing pressures. We also find that both winter and spring grazing can result in a larger difference in grass height between grazed and ungrazed plots, and grazing into the growing season delays the start of grass growth. This appears due to the relationship between grass height and growth rate. Because the optimal height for growth increases over the season, spring grazing has a much larger impact on grassland yields than winter grazing. Overall these results show that the amount of yield loss depends on different aspects of grazing, most prominently the recovery time, duration and grazing intensity. We hypothesize that barnacle geese may select fields with denser swards and may stimulate sward density by frequent grazing throughout winter and early spring as well as across consecutive years. Future studies should look into the effect of harvest delays and sward density on the size and quality of yield across the season and especially at the last cut. Management with scaring and accommodation may be able to reduce overall yield losses, but the effect may depend on the timing and location of scaring.},

  abstract = {In the 300-million-year evolutionary history of animal flight, fliers have universally evolved to exploit the physical principle of drag, whereby an animal uses wings to achieve lift. However, the treehopper Oeda -- an Amazonian insect exhibiting a grotesquely large balloon-like thorax -- has been described in what may be the only account of an animal engaging in buoyant flight, whereby an animal fills body cavities with low-density air to float, akin to a hot-air balloon. We use Oeda as a study system to conduct a theoretical analysis exploring the biomechanics of buoyant flight and the mechanisms preventing its widespread occurrence in animals. We show that not even an organism with the unique and disproportionate dimensions of Oeda can buoy more than 1\% of its body weight. Instead, our results suggest Oeda's bloated thorax is a hindrance for flight that has selected for larger wings to compensate for the species' disproportionate dimensions. Our analysis illustrates that animals may only achieve buoyant flight by filling cavities thousands of times larger than the body with heated low-density biogases. Still, the evolution of such traits is likely restricted by a variety of developmental and ecological factors that have prevented animals from evolving buoyant flight.

Recent evidence implicates monocytes/macrophages in the etiopathology of cardiac fibrosis, but giving their heterogeneity and the antagonizing roles of macrophage subtypes in fibrosis, targeting these cells has been challenging. Here we focus on WWP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts as a positive genetic regulator of human and murine cardiac fibrosis, and show that myeloid specific deletion of WWP2 reduces cardiac fibrosis in hypertension-induced NICM. By using single cell RNA sequencing analysis of immune cells in the same model, we establish the functional heterogeneity of macrophages and define an early pro-fibrogenic phase of NICM that is driven by Ccl5-expressing Ly6chigh monocytes. Among cardiac macrophage subtypes, WWP2 dysfunction primarily affects Ly6chigh monocytes via modulating Ccl5, and consequentially macrophage infiltration and activation, which contributes to reduced myofibroblast trans-differentiation. WWP2 interacts with transcription factor IRF7, promoting its non-degradative mono-ubiquitination, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, leading to upregulation of Ccl5 at transcriptional level. We identify a pro-fibrogenic macrophage subtype in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and demonstrate that WWP2 is a key regulator of IRF7-mediated Ccl5/Ly6chigh monocyte axis in heart fibrosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suanzaoren Decoction (SZRD), a well-known formula from traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to have reasonable cognitive effects while relaxing and alleviating insomnia. Several studies have demonstrated significant therapeutic effects of SZRD on diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the active ingredients and probable processes of SZRD in treating Alzheimer's with diabetes are unknown. This study aims to preliminarily elucidate the potential mechanisms and potential active ingredients of SZRD in the treatment of Alzheimer's with diabetes. METHODS: The main components and corresponding protein targets of SZRD were searched on the TCMSP database. Differential gene expression analysis for diabetes and Alzheimer's disease was conducted using the Gene Expression Omnibus database, with supplementation from OMIM and genecards databases for differentially expressed genes. The drug-compound-target-disease network was constructed using Cytoscape 3.8.0. Disease and SZRD targets were imported into the STRING database to construct a protein-protein interaction network. Further, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were performed on the intersection of genes. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on the Hub gene and active compounds. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to further analyze key genes. RESULTS: Through the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we obtained 1977 diabetes related genes and 622 AD related genes. Among drugs, diabetes and AD, 97 genes were identified. The drug-compound-target-disease network revealed that quercetin, kaempferol, licochalcone a, isorhamnetin, formononetin, and naringenin may be the core components exerting effects. PPI network analysis identified hub genes such as IL6, TNF, IL1B, CXCL8, IL10, CCL2, ICAM1, STAT3, and IL4. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that SZRD in the treatment of Alzheimer's with diabetes is mainly involved in biological processes such as response to drug, aging, response to xenobiotic, and enzyme binding; as well as signaling pathways such as Pathways in cancer, Chemical carcinogenesis - receptor activation, and Fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis. Molecular docking results showed that licochalcone a, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, and formononetin have high affinity with CXCL8, IL1B, and CCL2. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed a strong interaction between CXCL8 and licochalcone a, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that CXCL8, IL1B, and CCL2 have significant potential in diabetes. CONCLUSION: This study provides, for the first time, insights into the active ingredients and potential molecular mechanisms of SZRD in the treatment of Alzheimer's with diabetes, laying a theoretical foundation for future basic research.},

  abstract = {Questions Responses of ecological restoration projects to disturbances are rarely explored, yet their capacity to withstand and recover from disturbance (resilience) is a critical measure of restoration success. In many plant communities, the soil seedbank (SSB) provides an important source of propagules for species persistence and community resilience to disturbance. Understanding how SSBs develop with time can inform restoration of resilient ecosystems. Here, in fire-prone Banksia woodland restoration following sand mining, we ask: i. How does the smoke-responsive (dormancy broken by smoke) SSB develop through time, ii. What plant-trait and climate factors influence its development? and, iii. What do the data suggest for the resilience of these restored woodlands to fire? Location Ellenbrook, Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia (lat. -31.76, lon. 115.95) Methods We used smoke, a key germination cue associated with fire disturbance, to trigger germination of the SSB in Banksia woodland restoration. Using a chronosequence of nine ages between three and 26 years since initiation of restoration, we tested how the SSB develops using counts and richness of germinating native and invasive annuals, and native perennial obligate seeding and resprouting species. To understand the contribution of aboveground restored vegetation to SSB development, we compared S{\o}rensen's similarity of the smoke germinable SSB (`smoked SSB') and untreated germinable SSB (`control SSB') to aboveground vegetation. Results Smoked SSB germinant density decreased with restoration age for both native and invasive annuals but was stable for native perennials. Similarity between smoked SSB and aboveground vegetation was higher for perennial obligate seeders than for resprouters and peaked for perennials at 23 years. Conclusions Post-fire regeneration potential of the SSB was evident across the chronosequence, with restoration age influencing the density of native annuals and overall composition of the SSB. The findings for perennial species suggest an increase in resilience to fire with restoration age.},

  abstract = {High temperatures have been regarded as one of the main factors limiting Pyropia yezoensis cultivation in recent years. Both the heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes genes were activated timely before heat damage to the cell. Here, the activities of different antioxidant enzymes under different conditions, including HSF inhibitor, CaM inhibitor, and HSP70 protein inhibitor were determined. Then, RNA-seq was performed using samples that had been pretreated with corresponding chemicals under high temperature conditions. The principal component analysis inferred that the shift of gene transcription patterns under high temperature conditions was closely related to HSF since the addition of QR suppressed the changes in gene transcription pattern. The hsp70 genes and antioxidant enzyme genes were categorized into three groups by the method of WGCNA. And the HSE sites were identified using plantPAN and FIMO in most genes of the categories showed relationship to HSF. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of designated genes (FMPK {$>$}10) indicated that the expression of hsp70 and antioxidant enzyme genes in Py. yezoensis showed various transcriptional patterns, including upregulation, downregulation, and no significant changes in response to high temperature stress. The classification between qRT-PCR and WGCNA results showed a certain consistency. Considered the results above together, it was speculated that there were different HSFs regulated the expression of different genes of hsp70 and antioxidant enzymes, and HSP70 might also regulate the expression of anti-oxidase genes under the conditions of long-term stress. Additionally, transcription factors other than HSF might be involved in the high temperature stress response. The results indicated the complexity of heat stress response mechanisms in Py. yezoensis.},

This study aimed to identify pathogenic genes related to ferroptosis in the skin of humans after UVB radiation. Methods The gene expression profiles (GSE41078, GSE54413) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) were downloaded from the Genecards database. To identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and obtain differentially expressed FRGs by intersecting DEGs with FRGs. To identify the functional annotation and potential pathways by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Differentially expressed FRGs-associated protein--protein interaction network (PPI) was performed by STRING database and Cytoscape software. Results A total of 628 co-expressed DEGs of the two profiles (GSE41078 and GSE54413) were identified, including 371 upregulated and 257 downregulated DEGs. A total of 32 differentially expressed FRGs were identified. The results of GO analyses showed that, in the biological processes, UVB had a great influence on the response to oxidative stress; in the molecular functions, UVB had a great influence on antioxidant activity; in the cellular components, UVB had a great influence on endocytic vesicle lumen. The key pathways of differentially expressed FRGs were identified by KEGG analyses. The most significant 12 central node genes were identified by PPI network. Conclusion We identified differentially expressed FRGs candidate genes and pathways in UVB-induced skin photodamage, which could contribute to the development of new therapeutic targets for skin photodamage.},

  abstract = {Metabolites can mediate species interactions and the assembly of microbial communities. However, how these chemicals relate to the assembly processes and co-occurrence patterns of diazotrophic assemblages in root-associated soils remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the diversity and assembly of diazotrophic communities and further deciphered their links with metabolites on Tibetan Plateau. We found that the distribution of sugars and organic acids in the root-associated soils was significantly correlated with the richness of diazotrophs. The presence of these two soil metabolites explains the variability in diazotrophic community compositions. The differential concentrations of these metabolites were significantly linked with the distinctive abundances of diazotrophic taxa in same land types dominated by different plants or dissimilar soils by same plants. The assembly of diazotrophic communities is subject to deterministic ecological processes, which are widely modulated by the variety and amount of sugars and organic acids. Organic acids, for instance, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid and citric acid, were effective predictors of the characteristics of diazotrophic assemblages across desert habitats. Diazotrophic co-occurrence networks tended to be more complex and connected within different land types covered by the same plant species. The concentrations of multiple sugars and organic acids were coupled significantly with the distribution of keystone species, such as Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Bradyrhizobium, and Mesorhizobium, in the co-occurrence network. These findings provide new insights into the assembly mechanisms of root-associated diazotrophic communities across the desert ecosystems of the Tibetan Plateau.},

Previously hypothesized features, including the hydrophobicity of a protein product, and less well-known features, including binding energy centrality within a protein complex, predict oDNA retention across eukaryotes, with additional influences of nucleic acid and amino acid biochemistry. Notably, the same features predict retention in both organelles, and retention models learned from one organelle type quantitatively predict retention in the other, supporting the universality of these features---which also distinguish gene profiles in more recent, independent endosymbiotic relationships.

One approach would be to use (bacterio)phages and/or phage derivatives for therapy. In this study, we present a description of the first K. pneumoniae phage from the Zobellviridae family. The vB\_KpnP\_Klyazma podovirus, which forms translucent halos around the plaques, was isolated from river water. The phage genome is composed of 82 open reading frames, which are divided into two clusters located on opposite strands. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the phage belongs to the Zobellviridae family, although its identity with the closest member of this family was not higher than 5\%. The bacteriophage demonstrated lytic activity against all (n = 11) K. pneumoniae strains with the KL20 capsule type, but only the host strain was lysed effectively. The receptor-binding protein of the phage was identified as a polysaccharide depolymerase with a pectate lyase domain. The recombinant depolymerase protein showed concentration-dependent activity against all strains with the KL20 capsule type. The ability of a recombinant depolymerase to cleave bacterial capsular polysaccharides regardless of a phage's ability to successfully infect a particular strain holds promise for the possibility of using depolymerases in antimicrobial therapy, even though they only make bacteria sensitive to environmental factors, rather than killing them directly.},

But children who have undergone a hemispherectomy develop with only one hemisphere. The question is whether this preserved hemisphere, be it left or right, can support both word and face recognition. Here, a large sample of patients with childhood hemispherectomy and age-matched controls performed word- and face-matching tasks. Controls viewed stimuli either in one visual field (restricting initial processing to one hemisphere) or, like the patients, in central vision. Across word and face tasks, patients performed comparably to controls using primarily one hemisphere, but more poorly than controls viewing stimuli centrally with both hemispheres engaged. Additionally, patients showed deficits in low-level visual processing that may explain their word/face recognition deficits relative to controls. Altogether, the findings suggest that either hemisphere alone can support word and face recognition, albeit sub-optimally.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study, to provide a contemporary understanding of the IPD causing population in Victoria, Australia, we aimed to examine the population structure and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance using whole-genome sequencing and comprehensive antimicrobial susceptibility data of 1288 isolates collected between 2018 and 2022.

Serotypes contained in the 13v-PCV represented 35.3{$\mkern1mu\%$} (n=405) of isolates. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to at least one antibiotic was identified in 23.8{$\mkern1mu\%$} (n=358) of isolates with penicillin resistance the most prevalent (20.3{$\mkern1mu\%$}, n=261 using meningitis breakpoints and 5.1{$\mkern1mu\%$} n=65 using oral breakpoints). Of the AMR isolates, 28{$\mkern1mu\%$} (n=101) were multidrug resistant (MDR) (resistant to three or more drug classes). Vaccination status of cases was determined for a subset of isolates with 34 cases classified as vaccine failure events (fully vaccinated IPD cases of vaccine serotype). However, no phylogenetic association with failure events was observed. Within the highly diverse IPD population, we identified six high-risk sub-populations of public health concern characterized by high prevalence, high rates of AMR and MDR, or serotype inclusion in vaccines. High-risk serotypes included serotypes 3, 19F, 19A, 14, 11A, 15A and serofamily 23. In addition, we present our data validating seroBA for in silico serotyping to facilitate ISO-accreditation of this test in routine use in a public health reference laboratory and have made this data set available. This study provides insights into the population dynamics, highlights non-vaccine serotypes of concern that are highly resistant, and provides a genomic framework for the ongoing surveillance of IPD in Australia which can inform next-generation IPD prevention strategies.},

  abstract = {Gaeumannomyces tritici is responsible for take-all disease, one of the most important wheat root threats worldwide. High-quality annotated genome resources are sorely lacking for this pathogen, as well as for the closely related antagonist and potential wheat take-all biocontrol agent, G. hyphopodioides. As such, we know very little about the genetic basis of the interactions in this host-pathogen-antagonist system. Using PacBio HiFi sequencing technology we have generated nine near-complete assemblies, including two different virulence lineages for G. tritici and the first assemblies for G. hyphopodioides and G. avenae (oat take-all). Genomic signatures support the presence of two distinct virulence lineages in G. tritici (types A and B), with A strains potentially employing a mechanism to prevent gene copy-number expansions. The CAZyme repertoire was highly conserved across Gaeumannomyces, while candidate secreted effector proteins and biosynthetic gene clusters showed more variability and may distinguish pathogenic and non-pathogenic lineages. A transition from self-sterility (heterothallism) to self-fertility (homothallism) may also be a key innovation implicated in lifestyle. We did not find evidence for transposable element and effector gene compartmentalisation in the genus, however the presence of Starship giant transposable elements likely contributes to genomic plasticity in the genus. Our results depict Gaeumannomyces as an ideal system to explore interactions within the rhizosphere, the nuances of intraspecific virulence, interspecific antagonism, and fungal lifestyle evolution. The foundational genomic resources provided here will enable the development of diagnostics and surveillance of understudied but agriculturally important fungal pathogens.},

  abstract = {The rhizosphere, a narrow zone of soil near plant roots, is a hot spot for microbial activity. Rhizosphere microbiota directly or indirectly benefit plants by supplementing nutrients, producing beneficial chemicals, or suppressing pathogens. Plants attract and modulate bacteria within the rhizosphere by releasing exudates. Plants also tend to select the rhizosphere microbiota based on their needs; a phenomenon termed as ``rhizosphere effect''. In this study, we characterized the rhizosphere microbiota of peanut plants across the crop development cycle from pre-sowing of seeds to post-harvest of crop under field conditions. The rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from different crop developmental stages were also compared. The composition of bulk soil microbiota resembled microbiota of pre-sowing and post-harvest soil and was markedly different from rhizosphere soil samples. Rhizosphere samples were enriched with multiple organisms mostly from the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidota phyla. Differences in diversity were observed among the rhizosphere samples but not in bulk soil across different crop development stages. Pseudomonas\_M indica was highly enriched during the germination of seeds. Furthermore, Plant Growth Promoting (PGP) bacteria like Bacillus were enriched during the middle stages of crop development but there was a decline in PGP organisms in the matured crop stage. We also observed a significant association of pH and Electrical Conductivity (EC) with the profiles of microbial community. Overall, this study portrayed the changes in rhizosphere microbiota of peanut during different developmental stages of crop and may help to design stage specific bio-strategies such as bio-fertilizer to improve crop yield.},

  abstract = {In wet peatlands, plant growth conditions are largely determined by local soil conditions, leading to locally adapted vegetation. Despite that Carex species are often the prevailing vascular plant species in fen peatlands of the temperate zone, information about how these species adapt to local environmental conditions is scarce. This holds true especially for below-ground plant traits and for adaptations to fen-typical nutrient level variations. To address this research gap, we investigated how different geographic origins (Germany, Poland, The Netherlands) of C. acutiformis and C. rostrata relate to their response to varying nutrient availability. We performed a common garden experiment with a controlled gradient of nutrient levels, and analyzed above- and below-ground biomass production of both Carex species from the different geographic origins. We related these traits to environmental conditions of the origins as characterized by vegetation composition-derived indicator values for ecological habitat conditions. While we detected high above-ground phenotypic plasticity of Carex from different origins, our data point to below-ground genotypic differences, potentially indicating local adaptation: Rhizome traits of C. rostrata differed significantly between origins with different nutrient indicator values. These results point towards differences in C. rostrata clonal spread behavior depending on local peatland conditions. Therefore, local adaptations of plant species and below-ground biomass traits should be taken into account when studying peatland vegetation ecology, as key functional traits can differ between genotypes within a single species depending on local conditions.},

HEV was detected in rabbits from all states and territories, except the Northern Territory. Seroprevalence varied between locations (from 0\% to 22\%), demonstrating that HEV is widely distributed in rabbit populations across Australia. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Australian HEV sequences are genetically diverse and that HEV was likely introduced into Australia independently on several occasions. In summary, this study broadens our understanding of the genetic diversity of rabbit HEV globally and shows that the virus is endemic in both domestic and wild rabbit populations in Australia.},

Distributed across the Rolwaling Himal valley in Nepal between 3700 and 5100 m a.s.l. at eight automated weather stations (AWSs), meteorological data between October 2017 and September 2018 were examined. VWDs were classified by means of ERA5 reanalysis data and in situ observations, employing established thresholds using precipitation, solar radiation, air pressure, and wind speed data at different pressure levels. Thus, overlying synoptic influences are highly reduced and distinctive diurnal patterns emerge. A strong seasonal component in near-surface wind speed and wind direction patterns was detected. Further analyses showed the diurnal characteristics of slow (approximately 0.5--0.9 m s-1), but gradually increasing wind speeds over the night, transitional periods in the morning and evening, and the highest averaged wind speeds of approximately 4.3 m s-1 around noon during the VWDs. Wind directions followed a 180{$\circ$} shift with nocturnal katabatic mountain winds and inflowing anabatic valley winds during the daytime. With AWSs at opposing hillsides, slope winds were clearly identifiable and thermally driven spatio-temporal variations throughout the valley were revealed. Consequently, varying temporal shifts in wind speed and direction along the valley bottom can be extracted. In general, the data follow the well-known schematic of diurnal mountain--valley wind systems, but emphasize the influence of monsoonal seasonality and the surrounding complex mountain topography as decisive factors.},

Using a defined 117 strain community for which we generate high-quality genome assemblies, we model mucosa/lumen organization with in vitro cultures incorporating mucin hydrogel carriers as surfaces for bacterial attachment. Metagenomic tracking of carrier cultures reveals increased diversity and strain-specific spatial organization, with distinct strains enriched on carriers versus liquid supernatant, mirroring mucosa/lumen enrichment in vivo. A comprehensive search for microbial genes associated with this spatial organization identifies candidates with known adhesion-related functions, as well as novel links. These findings demonstrate that carrier cultures of defined communities effectively recapitulate fundamental aspects of gut spatial organization, enabling identification of key microbial strains and genes.},

  abstract = {Fungal plant pathogens have major impacts on agriculture and global food security and are likely to have an even greater impact in the future. The current tools that we have available to combat them are insufficient, in part because these fungi can quickly adapt to these tools. Understanding fungal plant pathogen evolution is therefore essential to curbing the threat these pathogens pose. In Chapter 1, I describe the motivations for my dissertation work and the state of the field of fungal plant pathogen evolution. I also introduce the model organism I used in my research, Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes the blast disease. Chapter 2 describes my characterization of the extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) of M. oryzae. EccDNAs are a diverse class of molecules that can contribute to phenotypic and genotypic plasticity in eukaryotes, and I hypothesized that these may be involved in fungal plant pathogen evolution. I show that M. oryzae has a more diverse set of eccDNAs than other organisms and that these are enriched in LTR retrotransposons. I also show that many genes are found on eccDNAs in M. oryzae, and that effectors are enriched on eccDNAs. Finally, I show that eccDNAs are associated with gene presence-absence variation (PAV). Next, in Chapter 3, I discuss in greater detail the results presented in Chapter 2, as well as their implications and potential future directions. I also further discuss evidence in Chapter 2 that led me to believe that eccDNAs do not play a major role in fungal plant pathogen evolution and led me to focus directly on gene PAV in M. oryzae in the remainder of my dissertation. Subsequently, in Chapter 4, I describe my characterization of these events in M. oryzae. I find that genes experiencing PAV between lineages of M. oryzae are enriched in disease-causing and non-self-recognition genes. I describe how gene PAV events in the rice and wheat pathotypes show clear differences in their count and genomic location. Through comparing PAV genes to conserved genes, I show that these had distinct distances to TEs, distances to other genes, lengths, GC content, expression, and epigenetic marks. I also describe how a machine learning model can be trained to take advantage of these features to predict genes prone to PAV in the M. oryzae genome. Finally, in Chapter 5, I further discuss the implications of the results I describe in this dissertation, as well as future directions for implementing machine learning models and general knowledge of fungal plant pathogen evolution to help guide rational disease resistance engineering in crops.},

  abstract = {Background Fungi use the accessory segments of their pan-genomes to adapt to their environments. While gene presence-absence variation (PAV) contributes to shaping these accessory gene reservoirs, whether these events happen in specific genomic contexts remains unclear. Additionally, since pan-genome studies often group together all members of the same species, it is uncertain whether genomic or epigenomic features shaping pan-genome evolution are consistent across populations within the same species. Fungal plant pathogens are useful models for answering these questions because members of the same species often infect distinct hosts, and they frequently rely on gene PAV to adapt to these hosts. Results We analyzed gene PAV in the rice and wheat blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and found that PAV of disease-causing effectors, antibiotic production, and non-self-recognition genes may drive the adaptation of the fungus to its environment. We then analyzed genomic and epigenomic features and data from available datasets for patterns that might help explain these PAV events. We observed that proximity to transposable elements (TEs), gene GC content, gene length, expression level in the host, and histone H3K27me3 marks were different between PAV genes and conserved genes, among other features. We used these features to construct a random forest classifier that was able to predict whether a gene is likely to experience PAV with high precision (86.06\%) and recall (92.88\%) in rice-infecting M. oryzae. Finally, we found that PAV in wheat- and rice-infecting pathotypes of M. oryzae differed in their number and their genomic context. Conclusions Our results suggest that genomic and epigenomic features of gene PAV can be used to better understand and even predict fungal pan-genome evolution. We also show that substantial intra-species variation can exist in these features.},

  abstract = {Lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) display a broad histological spectrum from low-grade lepidic tumors through to mid-grade acinar and papillary and high-grade solid, cribriform and micropapillary tumors. How morphology reflects tumor evolution and disease progression is poorly understood. Whole-exome sequencing data generated from 805 primary tumor regions and 121 paired metastatic samples across 248 LUADs from the TRACERx 421 cohort, together with RNA-sequencing data from 463 primary tumor regions, were integrated with detailed whole-tumor and regional histopathological analysis. Tumors with predominantly high-grade patterns showed increased chromosomal complexity, with higher burden of loss of heterozygosity and subclonal somatic copy number alterations. Individual regions in predominantly high-grade pattern tumors exhibited higher proliferation and lower clonal diversity, potentially reflecting large recent subclonal expansions. Co-occurrence of truncal loss of chromosomes 3p and 3q was enriched in predominantly low-/mid-grade tumors, while purely undifferentiated solid-pattern tumors had a higher frequency of truncal arm or focal 3q gains and SMARCA4 gene alterations compared with mixed-pattern tumors with a solid component, suggesting distinct evolutionary trajectories. Clonal evolution analysis revealed that tumors tend to evolve toward higher-grade patterns. The presence of micropapillary pattern and `tumor spread through air spaces' were associated with intrathoracic recurrence, in contrast to the presence of solid/cribriform patterns, necrosis and preoperative circulating tumor DNA detection, which were associated with extra-thoracic recurrence. These data provide insights into the relationship between LUAD morphology, the underlying evolutionary genomic landscape, and clinical and anatomical relapse risk.},

Drought risks, compounded with projected flood intensification, pose significant threats for this transboundary river.

  abstract = {Phage therapy is now seen as a promising way to overcome the current global crisis in the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, phages are highly strain-specific, and in most cases one will have to isolate a new phage or search for a phage suitable for a therapeutic application in existing libraries. At an early stage of the isolation process, rapid screening techniques are needed to identify and type potential virulent phages. Here, we propose a simple PCR approach to differentiate between two families of virulent Staphylococcus phages (Herelleviridae and Rountreeviridae) and eleven genera of virulent Klebsiella phages (Przondovirus, Taipeivirus, Drulisvirus, Webervirus, Jiaodavirus, Sugarlandvirus, Slopekvirus, Jedunavirus, Marfavirus, Mydovirus and Yonseivirus). This assay includes a thorough search of a dataset comprising S. aureus (n = 269) and K. pneumoniae (n = 480) phage genomes available in the NCBI RefSeq/GenBank database for specific genes that are highly conserved at the taxonomic group level. The selected primers showed high sensitivity and specificity for both isolated DNA and crude phage lysates, which permits circumventing DNA purification protocols. Our approach can be extended and applied to any group of phages, given the large number of available genomes in the databases.},

  abstract = {Due to successful conservation initiatives and legislations, the grey wolf (Canis lupus) is re-colonising its historic range in Europe. However, wolves have never been extirpated across large areas in Eastern Europe but are often constrained to remote and inaccessible places due to centuries of persecution. This study aimed to identify the potentially suitable wolf habitats in Polesia, a massive cross-border lowland region extending over southern Belarus and northern Ukraine, which are often neglcted in large carnivore studies at the continental scale. We hypothesized that anthropogenic rather than environmental factors govern wolf habitat suitability. We used a dataset of 4,191 GPS locations obtained from radio-collared wolves (n=26) and confirmed observations (n=231) during 2014-2021 and applied maximum entropy method to estimate relative habitat suitability for wolves in Polesia. Artificial light at night (ALAN), proportion of cropland and tree cover were the most important factors affecting wolf habitat suitability. Road densities contributed poorly to predicting habitat suitability for wolves. Our models predicted a quarter of Polesia as suitable habitat and revealed priority areas connecting the important source populations in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in the east and the Bia{\l}owie{\.z}a Forest in the west and thus essential for long-term wolf conservation. Our results provide the bases for effective, long-term wolf monitoring and management programs in both Belarus and Ukraine. However, national and transboundary wolf management in Polesia has been extremely challenging since 2022 due to the ongoing war and subsequent habitat degradation in this part of Europe.},

Studies have constructed the genetic polymorphism spectrum of Han Chinese, whereas high-resolution investigations are still missing to unveil its fine-scale substructure and trace the genetic imprints for its demographic history. Here we construct a haplotype network consisted of 111,000 genome-wide genotyped Han Chinese individuals from direct-to-consumer genetic testing and over 1.3 billion identity-by-descent (IBD) links. We observed a clear separation of the northern and southern Han Chinese and captured 5 subclusters and 17 sub-subclusters in haplotype network hierarchical clustering, corresponding to geography (especially mountain ranges), immigration waves, and clans with cultural-linguistic segregation. We inferred differentiated split histories and founder effects for population clans Cantonese, Hakka, and Minnan-Chaoshanese in southern China, and also unveiled more recent demographic events within the past few centuries, such as \emph{Zou Xikou} and \emph{Chuang Guandong}. The composition shifts of the native and current residents of four major metropolitans (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) imply a rapidly vanished genetic barrier between subpopulations. Our study yields a fine-scale population structure of Han Chinese and provides profound insights into the nation's genetic and cultural-linguistic multiformity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

During 2016-2019, a series of regional point prevalence surveys identified increasing prevalence of blaNDM-containing CRE in multiple long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) and ventilator-capable skilled nursing facilities (vSNFs). We performed a genomic epidemiology investigation of blaNDM-producing CRE to understand their regional emergence and spread.We performed whole-genome sequencing on NDM+ CRE isolates from four point-prevalence surveys across 35 facilities (LTACHs, vSNFs, and acute care hospital medical intensive care units) in the Chicago area and investigated the genomic relatedness and transmission dynamics of these isolates over time.Genomic analyses revealed that the rise of NDM+ CRE was due to the clonal dissemination of an ST147 Klebsiella pneumoniae strain harboring blaNDM-1 on an IncF plasmid. Dated phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that ST147 was introduced into the region around 2013 and likely acquired NDM around 2015. Analyzing the relatedness of strains within and between facilities supported initial increases in prevalence due to intra-facility transmission in certain vSNFs, with evidence of subsequent inter-facility spread among LTACHs and vSNFs connected by patient transfer.We identified a regional outbreak of blaNDM-1 ST147 that began in and disseminated across Chicago area post-acute care facilities. Our findings highlight the importance of performing genomic surveillance at post-acute care facilities to identify emerging threats.},

This study aimed at (1) comparing the microclimate adjacent to a swimming pool against two control sites and (2) quantifying the pool's cooling and humidification effects. We employed high-precision sensors to measure air temperature, humidity, black-globe temperature, and incoming and outgoing radiation at a swimming pool, nearby tennis court and turf sites in Hong Kong's humid-subtropical summer. On sunny days, we found a maximum poolside air temperature of 36.6{$^\circ$}C at 0.15 m height. The highest vapour pressure of 3.14--4.13 kPa occurred on cloudy days. Cooler rainy days lowered vapour pressure. Net short-wave radiation gain peaked at 840 W/m2 on sunny days. The findings suggested that energy stored in the morning retarded surface cooling later in the day. The morning poolside surface temperature was cooler than the turf by 3.8{$^\circ$}C but warmer by 5.7{$^\circ$}C in the afternoon, with lingering nighttime warming. Unexpectedly, the pool had lower vapour pressure than the control sites. The water body does not ameliorate heat stress on the deck in sunny conditions.

Furthermore, we showed that the T492I mutation increases the replication capacity and infectiveness of the virus and improves its ability to evade host immune responses. Mechanistically, the T492I mutation increases the cleavage efficiency of the viral main protease NSP5 by enhancing enzyme-substrate binding, which increases production of nearly all non-structural proteins processed by NSP5. Importantly, the T492I mutation suppresses viral-RNA-associated chemokine production in monocytic macrophages, which may contribute to the attenuated pathogenicity of Omicron variants.

  abstract = {Background Virus Yellows (VY), a disease caused by several aphid-borne viruses, is a major threat to the global sugar beet production. Following the ban of neonicotinoid-based seed treatments against aphids in Europe, increased efforts are needed to monitor and forecast aphid population spread during the sugar beet growing season. In particular, predicting aphid flight seasonal activity could allow anticipation of the timing and intensity of crop colonisation and contribute to the proper implementation of management methods. Forecasts should be made early enough to assess risk, but can be updated as the season progresses to refine management. Based on a long-term suction-trap dataset gathered between 1978 to 2014, we built and evaluated a set of models to predict the flight activity features of the main VY vector, Myzus persicae, at any location in the French sugar beet production area (circa 4.105 ha). Flight onset dates, length of flight period and cumulative abundance of flying aphids were predicted using climatic and land-use predictors as well as geographical position. Results Our predictions outperformed current models published in the literature. The importance of the predictor variables varied according to the predicted flight feature but winter and early spring temperature always played a major role. Forecasts based on temperature were made more accurate by adding predictors related to aphid winter reservoirs. In addition, updating the model parameters to take advantage of new weather data acquired during the season improved the flight forecast. Conclusion Our models can be used as a tool for the mitigation in sugar beet crops. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a major subtype of lung cancer with limited therapeutic options and poor clinical prognosis. Methods Three datasets (GSE19188, GSE33532 and GSE33479) were obtained from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LUSC and normal tissues were identified by GEO2R, and functional analysis was employed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online tool. Protein--protein interaction (PPI) and hub genes were identified via the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) and Cytoscape software. Hub genes were further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Subsequently, survival analysis was performed using the Kapla--Meier curve and Cox progression analysis. Based on univariate and multivariate Cox progression analysis, a gene signature was established to predict overall survival. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the prognostic value of the model. Results A total of 116 up-regulated genes and 84 down-regulated genes were identified. These DEGs were mainly enriched in the two pathways: cell cycle and p53 signaling way. According to the degree of protein nodes in the PPI network, 10 hub genes were identified. The mRNA expression levels of the 10 hub genes in LUSC were also significantly up-regulated in the TCGA database. Furthermore, a novel seven-gene signature (FLRT3, PPP2R2C, MMP3, MMP12, CAPN8, FILIP1 and SPP1) from the DEGs was constructed and acted as a significant and independent prognostic signature for LUSC. Conclusions The 10 hub genes might be tightly correlated with LUSC progression. The seven-gene signature might be an independent biomarker with a significant predictive value in LUSC overall survival.},

There is increasing evidence that measurement of the total count and concentration of microbes in the gut, or `absolute abundance', provides a richer source of information than relative abundance and can correct some conclusions drawn from relative abundance data. However, little is known about how preservative choice can affect these measurements. In this study, we investigated how two common preservatives and short-term storage conditions impact relative and absolute microbial measurements. OMNIgene GUT OMR-200 yields lower metagenomic taxonomic variation between different storage temperatures, whereas Zymo DNA/RNA Shield yields lower metatranscriptomic taxonomic variation. Absolute abundance quantification reveals two different causes of variable Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratios across preservatives. Based on these results, we recommend OMNIgene GUT OMR-200 preservative for field studies and Zymo DNA/RNA Shield for metatranscriptomics studies, and we strongly encourage absolute quantification for microbial measurements.},

  abstract = {A freshwater photosynthetic arsenite-oxidizing bacterium, Cereibacter azotoformans strain ORIO, was isolated from Owens River, CA, USA. The waters from Owens River are elevated in arsenic and serve as the headwaters to the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The complete genome sequence of strain ORIO is 4.8 Mb genome (68\% G + C content) and comprises two chromosomes and six plasmids. Taxonomic analysis placed ORIO within the Cereibacter genus (formerly Rhodobacter). The ORIO genome contains arxB2AB1CD (encoding an arsenite oxidase), arxXSR (regulators) and several ars arsenic resistance genes all co-localised on a 136 kb plasmid, named pORIO3. Phylogenetic analysis of ArxA, the molybdenum-containing arsenite oxidase catalytic subunit, demonstrated photoarsenotrophy is likely to occur within members of the Alphaproteobacteria. ORIO is a mixotroph, oxidises arsenite to arsenate (As(V)) photoheterotrophically, and expresses arxA in cultures grown with arsenite. Further ecophysiology studies with Owens River sediment demonstrated the interconversion of arsenite and As(V) was dependent on light--dark cycling. arxA and arrA (As(V) respiratory reductase) genes were detected in the light--dark cycled sediment metagenomes suggesting syntrophic interactions among arsenotrophs. This work establishes C. azotoformans str. ORIO as a new model organism for studying photoarsenotrophy and light--dark arsenic biogeochemical cycling.},

  abstract = {Photoarsenotrophy is an anoxygenic photosynthesis-dependent arsenite oxidation pathway encoded by the Arx gene cluster and is linked to light-dark cycling of arsenic in freshwater environments. This dissertation uses techniques from microbiology, molecular genetics, DNA sequencing, and analytical chemistry to characterize photoarsenotrophy in freshwater environments. The hypothesis is that photoarsenotrophy occurs in freshwater environments and is associated with light-dark cycling of arsenic, which may have a different effect on arsenic biogeochemical cycling when compared to Arx-type arsenotrophy. Light-dark arsenic redox cycling is defined herein as variations in arsenic species, arsenite and arsenate, that correlate to light or dark phases.Since the discovery of photoarsenotrophy in 2008, less than a dozen Arx-dependent arsenotrophs have been isolated, and light-dependent arsenite oxidation has only been detected in three genera (Ectothiorhodospira sp. strains MLW-1, PHS-1, BSL-9, Ect. shaposhnikovii strains DSM 243 and DSM 2001, Halorhodospira halophila SL-1, and now Cereibacter azotoformans str. ORIO). The other studied Arx-dependent arsenotrophs couple arsenite oxidation to anaerobic respiration (i.e., nitrate reduction) instead of anoxygenic photosynthesis (Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii str. MLHE-1, Azoarcus sp. CIB, Sterolibacteraceae strain M52, Desulfotomaculum strain TC-1, and Halomonas sp. ANAO440). In this thesis, I define the light requirement by referring to photosynthesis-dependent arsenite-oxidation as photoarsenotrophy, and photosynthesis-independent Arx-type arsenite-oxidation as Arx-type arsenotrophy. This difference in light requirement is important as it introduces the possibility that light-dark cycling of arsenic could occur in environments containing a photoarsenotroph and arsenate reducer, since Arx-type arsenotrophs are able to oxidize arsenite in the dark so long there is availability of a terminal electron acceptor.The first question investigated was: Does photoarsenotrophy occur in freshwater environments? This question was studied through the isolation and genetic characterization of a novel photoarsenotroph from freshwater sediments in Owens River, CA, USA. Our results show the photoarsenotrophs are present in freshwater environments and harbor the Arx genes required for photoarsenotrophy.The second question investigated was: Can arsenic be light-dark cycled in the environment? In other words, do concentrations of different arsenic forms correlate to the light phase or dark phase of a day? To answer this question, we performed anaerobic microcosm studies with sediment collected from Owens River. Arsenic speciation was measured over light-dark cycles and was followed by metagenome sequencing and analysis. The results provide evidence of light-dark cycling in freshwater sediments and the potential genes involved in the cycle. The third question investigated was: Can we develop a new model organism for studying photoarsenotrophy? We successfully determined that Cereibacter azotoformans str. ORIO is genetically malleable using traditional cloning techniques and can serve as a model for studying the biological mechanism underlying photoarsenotrophy. This was achieved by validating the role of the arxA gene in ORIO and characterizing the physiology surrounding arsenite oxidation.Taken together, these studies show photoarsenotrophy occurs in freshwater environments, ORIO can serve as a model organism for studying photoarsenotrophy, and evidence of light-dark arsenic redox cycling in freshwater sediments.},

  abstract = {Germinal centers play a key role in the adaptive immune system since they are able to produce memory B cells and plasma cells that produce high affinity antibodies for an effective immune protection. The mechanisms underlying cell-fate decisions are not well understood but asymmetric division of antigen, B-cell receptor affinity, interactions between B-cells and T follicular helper cells (triggering CD40 signaling), and regulatory interactions of transcription factors have all been proposed to play a role. In addition, a temporal switch from memory B-cell to plasma cell differentiation during the germinal center reaction has been shown. To investigate if antigen affinity-based Tfh cell help recapitulates the temporal switch we implemented a multiscale model that integrates cellular interactions with a core gene regulatory network comprising BCL6, IRF4, and BLIMP1. Using this model we show that affinity-based CD40 signaling in combination with asymmetric division of B-cells result in switch from memory B-cell to plasma cell generation during the course of the germinal center reaction. We also show that cell fate division is unlikely to be (solely) based on asymmetric division of Ag but that BLIMP1 is a more important factor. Altogether, our model enables to test the influence of molecular modulations of the CD40 signaling pathway on the production of germinal center output cells.},

All Salmonella isolates were found to be monophasic S. enterica serovar Typhimurium variant Copenhagen of ST34. rmtB-harbouring E. coli isolates were found to be one of three STs: ST4089, ST1684 and ST34. Long-read sequencing identified the rmtB gene to be chromosomally located in Salmonella isolates and on IncFII-type plasmids in E. coli isolates. The results showed the rmtB gene to be flanked by IS26 elements and several resistance genes.We report on the occurrence of rmtB-harbouring Enterobacteriaceae on a pig farm in the UK. rmtB confers resistance to multiple aminoglycosides and this work highlights the need for surveillance to assess dissemination and risk.}

  abstract = {Hydroclimatic time series analysis focuses on a few feature types (e.g., autocorrelations, trends, extremes), which describe a small portion of the entire information content of the observations. Aiming to exploit a larger part of the available information and, thus, to deliver more reliable results (e.g., in hydroclimatic time series clustering contexts), here we approach hydroclimatic time series analysis differently, i.e., by performing massive feature extraction. In this respect, we develop a big data framework for hydroclimatic variable behaviour characterization. This framework relies on approximately 60 diverse features and is completely automatic (in the sense that it does not depend on the hydroclimatic process at hand). We apply the new framework to characterize mean monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and mean monthly river flow. The applications are conducted at the global scale by exploiting 40-year-long time series originating from over 13 000 stations. We extract interpretable knowledge on seasonality, trends, autocorrelation, long-range dependence and entropy, and on feature types that are met less frequently. We further compare the examined hydroclimatic variable types in terms of this knowledge and, identify patterns related to the spatial variability of the features. For this latter purpose, we also propose and exploit a hydroclimatic time series clustering methodology. This new methodology is based on Breiman's random forests. The descriptive and exploratory insights gained by the global-scale applications prove the usefulness of the adopted feature compilation in hydroclimatic contexts. Moreover, the spatially coherent patterns characterizing the clusters delivered by the new methodology build confidence in its future exploitation. Given this spatial coherence and the scale-independent nature of the delivered feature values (which makes them particularly useful in forecasting and simulation contexts), we believe that this methodology could also be beneficial within regionalization frameworks, in which knowledge on hydrological similarity is exploited in technical and operative terms.},

However, little is known about viral genetic features and evolutionary patterns in these environments. Here, we examined the evolutionary ecology of viruses across active and extinct seep stages in the area of Haima cold seeps in the South China Sea. A total of 338 viral operational taxonomic units are identified and linked to 36 bacterial and archaeal phyla. The dynamics of host-virus interactions are informed by diverse antiviral defense systems across 43 families found in 487 microbial genomes. Cold seep viruses are predicted to harbor diverse adaptive strategies to persist in this environment, including counter-defense systems, auxiliary metabolic genes, reverse transcriptases, and alternative genetic code assignments. Extremely low nucleotide diversity is observed in cold seep viral populations, being influenced by factors including microbial host, sediment depth, and cold seep stage. Most cold seep viral genes are under strong purifying selection with trajectories that differ depending on whether cold seeps are active or extinct. This work sheds light on the understanding of environmental adaptation mechanisms and evolutionary patterns of viruses in the sub-seafloor biosphere.},

Soil carbon pools in highly productive tropical and temperate forests were dominated by the unprotected carbon fraction and were highly vulnerable to reductions in ecosystem productivity and warming. Conversely, soil carbon in low productivity, drier and colder ecosystems was dominated by mineral-protected carbon, and was less responsive to warming. Our findings emphasize the importance of conserving ecosystem productivity to protect carbon stored in surface soils.},

For instance, one may use upper thermal limits to estimate current and future thermal safety margins (i.e., the proximity of upper thermal limits to experienced temperatures), use this trait together with other physiological traits in species distribution models, or investigate the plasticity and evolvability of these limits for buffering the impacts of changing temperatures. While datasets on thermal tolerance limits have been previously compiled, they sometimes report single estimates for a given species, do not present measures of data dispersion, and are biased towards certain parts of the globe. To overcome these limitations, we systematically searched the literature in seven languages to produce the most comprehensive dataset to date on amphibian upper thermal limits, spanning 3,095 estimates across 616 species. This resource will represent a useful tool to evaluate the vulnerability of amphibians, and ectotherms more generally, to changing temperatures.},

This approach consists of an ensemble of hydrological model (HM) simulations (generated via different parameter sets) whose residuals are `corrected' by a data-driven model (one per HM parameter set), resulting in an improved ensemble simulation. Through a case study involving three Swiss catchments, it was demonstrated that CDDA generates significantly improved ensemble streamflow simulations when compared to the ensemble HM. In this follow-up study, a stochastic version of CDDA (SCDDA) is developed that, in addition to parameter uncertainty, accounts for input data, input variable selection, and model output uncertainty. Using several deterministic and probabilistic performance metrics, it is shown that SCDDA results in significantly more accurate and reliable ensemble-based streamflow simulations than the CDDA, ensemble and stochastic HMs, and a quantile regression-based approach, improving the mean interval score by 26--79\%.},

Saccharomycetaceae was the yeast family more abundant in WK, and Dipodascaceae and Pichiaceae in MK. Regarding KEGG mapping of functional orthologs, the four kefir samples shared 70\% of KO entries of yeast genes but only 36\% of bacterial genes. Concerning main metabolic processes, the relative abundance of transcripts associated with metabolism (energy metabolism) and environmental information processing (membrane transport) had the highest water/milk kefir ratio observed in Firmicutes. In contrast, transcripts associated with genetic information processing (protein translation, folding, sorting, and degradation) oppositely had the lowest water/milk ratios. Concluding, milk and water kefir have quite different communities of microorganisms. Still, the main mapped functional processes are similar, with only quantitative variation in membrane transport and energy acquisition in the water kefir and protein synthesis and turnover in the milk kefir.},

However, thermokarst feature mapping is limited in scope, and observed responses of carbon fluxes to abrupt thaw are variable. We developed a thermokarst detection algorithm that identifies thermokarst features from a single elevation dataset with 71.5 percent accuracy and applied it in Healy, Alaska. Additionally, we investigated the landscape-level variation in carbon dioxide and methane fluxes by extent of abrupt thaw using eddy covariance. Seven percent of the site was classified as thermokarst. Water tracks were the most extensive form of thermokarst, although small pits were much more numerous. Abrupt thaw was positively correlated with carbon uptake during the growing season, when increases in gross primary productivity outpaced increases in ecosystem respiration in vegetation-dense water tracks. However, this was outweighed by higher carbon release in thermokarst features during the nongrowing season. Additionally, abrupt thaw was positively correlated with methane production nearly year-round. Our findings support the hypothesis that abrupt thaw of permafrost carbon will contribute to the permafrost climate feedback above and beyond that associated with gradual thaw and highlights the need to map thermokarst and incorporate abrupt thaw into Earth System Models.},

We run a series of phylogenetic generalized least-squares models on 227 species of squamates to test for possible relationships between genome size and ecological factors including latitudinal distribution, bioclimatic variables and microhabitat use. We also tested whether genome size variation can be associated with parity mode, a highly variable life history trait in this order of reptiles.},

Here, we propose, implement, and test a combined procedure for reaction lumping, applicable to genome-scale metabolic models. It is based on identification of groups of metabolites with unknown \$\$\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\_\{f\} G{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$\$whose elimination can be conducted independently of the others via: (1) group implementation, aiming to eliminate an entire such group, and, if this is infeasible, (2) a sequential implementation to ensure that a maximal number of metabolites with unknown \$\$\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\_\{f\} G{\textasciicircum}\{0\}\$\$are eliminated. Our comparative analysis with genome-scale metabolic models of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Homo sapiens shows that the combined procedure provides an efficient means for systematic identification of lumped reactions. We also demonstrate that TMFA applied to models with reactions lumped according to the proposed procedure lead to more precise predictions in comparison to the original models. The provided implementation thus ensures the reproducibility of the findings and their application with standard TMFA.},

  abstract = {Forecasts of increased frequency of meteorological extremes have received considerable attention due to their potential impact on the integrity of biotic communities, stability of terrestrial and aquatic environments, availability of ecosystem services, and broader societal prosperity. Canada is projected to experience greater warming rates than many other regions of the world and changes in meteorological extremes are predicted to be variable across the country. In this context, our goal is to evaluate the long-term trends of extreme meteorological variables (air and dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) in southern and central Ontario (from 42{$^\circ$}N to 50{$^\circ$}N), while considering the role dynamics of large-scale atmospheric oscillations (El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Air temperature minima increased year-round, while temperature maxima mainly increased during the cooler months of the year. Consistent with recent evidence from the literature, our study identified an increase in the amount of atmospheric water since the 1950s, as shown by the rising trends in dew point temperature maxima and minima during winter and mid-summer/early-autumn, respectively. Likewise, we found a weak decline in the relative humidity during the warm season, and a more discernible declining trend during the cooler part of the year, which could be in turn reflective of the moderate change of temperature maxima and rising minima, respectively. Consistent with the broader evidence of a global terrestrial stilling, our analysis showed a declining occurrence of high wind-speed events across the entire study domain, and frequent slow-wind speeds during both warm and cold periods of the year. Interestingly, a closer examination of temporal trends in calm wind frequency provides evidence of a recent reversal in the latter trend with diminishing prevalence of very calm wind conditions. We generally found a weakly increasing temporal trend with maximum total daily precipitation, but without a coherent spatial pattern within the broader study area. Our analysis showed that large-scale phenomena have a discernible signature mostly on air temperature and humidity variables, but had little impact on low relative humidity, high and low wind-speed, and precipitation variability. Given the modest impact of teleconnections on long-term temporal trends, our study concludes that the meteorological extremes are more directly influenced by regional and local heat and humidity balance processes rather than global-scale atmospheric mechanisms. The observed trends of air temperature, humidity, and wind speed extremes suggest a profound impact on the phenology of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and human experience of weather.},

  abstract = {Background While genome-resolved metagenomics has revolutionized our understanding of microbial and genetic diversity in environmental samples, assemblies of short-reads often result in incomplete and/or highly fragmented metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), hampering in-depth genomics. Although Nanopore sequencing has increasingly been used in microbial metagenomics as long reads greatly improve the assembly quality of MAGs, the recommended DNA quantity usually exceeds the recoverable amount of DNA of environmental samples. Here, we evaluated lower-than-recommended DNA quantities for Nanopore library preparation by determining sequencing quality, community composition, assembly quality and recovery of MAGs. Results We generated 27 Nanopore metagenomes using the commercially available ZYMO mock community and varied the amount of input DNA from 1000 ng (the recommended minimum) down to 1 ng in eight steps. The quality of the generated reads remained stable across all input levels. The read mapping accuracy, which reflects how well the reads match a known reference genome, was consistently high across all libraries. The relative abundance of the species in the metagenomes was stable down to input levels of 50 ng. High-quality MAGs ({$>$} 95\% completeness, {$\leq$} 5\% contamination) could be recovered from metagenomes down to 35 ng of input material. When combined with publicly available Illumina reads for the mock community, Nanopore reads from input quantities as low as 1 ng improved the quality of hybrid assemblies. Conclusion Our results show that the recommended DNA amount for Nanopore library preparation can be substantially reduced without any adverse effects to genome recovery and still bolster hybrid assemblies when combined with short-read data. We posit that the results presented herein will enable studies to improve genome recovery from low-biomass environments, enhancing microbiome understanding.},

The spread of the non-pathogenic lagoviruses, e.g., rabbit calicivirus (RCV), is less well studied as the infection results in no clinical signs. Nonetheless, RCV has important implications for the spread of RHDV and rabbit biocontrol as it can provide varying levels of cross-protection against fatal infection with pathogenic lagoviruses. In Chile, where European rabbits are also an introduced species, myxoma virus was used for localised biocontrol of rabbits in the 1950s. To date, there have been no studies investigating the presence of lagoviruses in the Chilean feral rabbit population. In this study, liver and duodenum rabbit samples from central Chile were tested for the presence of lagoviruses and positive samples were subject to whole RNA sequencing and subsequent data analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a novel RCV variant in duodenal samples that likely originated from European RCVs. Sequencing analysis also detected the presence of a rabbit astrovirus in one of the lagovirus-positive samples.},

We hypothesize that peptide vaccines containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell stimulation would drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity, potentially avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we propose a set of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies and clinical trials.,},

  abstract = {Systematic changes have been observed in the functional architecture of the human brain with advancing age. However, functional connectivity (FC) is also a powerful feature to detect unique ``connectome fingerprints'', allowing identification of individuals among their peers. Although fingerprinting has been robustly observed in samples of young adults, the reliability of this approach has not been demonstrated across the lifespan. We applied the fingerprinting framework to the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience cohort (n = 483 aged 18 to 89 years). We found that individuals are ``fingerprintable'' (i.e., identifiable) across independent functional MRI scans throughout the lifespan. We observed a U-shape distribution in the strength of ``self-identifiability'' (within-individual correlation across modalities), and ``others-identifiability'' (between-individual correlation across modalities), with a decrease from early adulthood into middle-age, before improving in older age. FC edges contributing to self-identifiability were not restricted to specific brain networks and were different between individuals across the lifespan sample. Self-identifiability was additionally associated with regional brain volume. These findings indicate that individual participant-level identification is preserved across the lifespan despite the fact that its components are changing non-linearly.Important inter-individual differences are increasingly identified in functional connectivity studies. However, most of the work to date has focused on samples of younger adults, ignoring older individuals in which brains undergo significant transformation. Here, we examine individual-level patterns of functional connectivity---i.e., connectome fingerprints---across the adult lifespan. Our results suggest that connectome fingerprints can reliably predict individuals from independent brain scans across the lifespan. Additionally, regions contributing to fingerprints differed from person to person, emphasizing the extent of inter-individual differences in the brain. Specific patterns of brain volume, associated with normative age-related atrophy, may impact the identification of individual-specific functional connectivity patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of inter-individual variability in functional connectivity, regardless of participant age, when assessing individual differences in brain function.},

We defined infections as CO, HO, or HACO epidemiologically. We integrated genomic, community exposure, and statewide hospital discharge data to infer MRSA origin.Among 1020 individuals with available WGS, most were USA300 wound infections (580 CO, 143 HO, 297 HACO). USA300 HO, CO, and HACO infections were intermixed on the USA300 phylogeny consistent with common strains circulating across community and healthcare settings. Community exposures (e.g. substance abuse, incarceration, homelessness) were associated with HACO and HO infections, and genetically-linked individuals from both groups had little overlap in healthcare facilities, supporting community origins. Most repeat infections---over months-to-years---occurred in individuals persistently carrying their own strains. These individuals were more likely to have genetic linkages, suggesting a role of persistent colonization in transmission.Efforts to reduce presumed nosocomial USA300 spread may require understanding and controlling community sources and transmission networks, particularly for repeat infections.}

However, it can be challenging in routine practice, warranting strategies to adapt to different clinical contexts. In light of this, this study aimed to describe the implementation process of the ePRO system and elucidate the provider-level implementation barriers and facilitators to a novel ePRO system at cancer hospitals in Japan. Methods We implemented an ePRO system linked to electronic medical records at three cancer hospitals. Fifteen patients with solid cancers at the outpatient oncology unit were asked to regularly complete the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE™) questionnaire and European Organization for Research and Treatment Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) by using the smartphone app between October 2021 and June 2022. Thirteen healthcare professionals were interviewed to identify implementation barriers and facilitators to the ePRO system by using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research framework. Results The healthcare professionals identified a lack of clinical resources and a culture and system that emphasizes treatment over care as the main barriers; however, the accumulation of successful cases, the leadership of managers, and the growing needs of patients can serve as facilitators to the implementation. Conclusions Our experience implementing an ePRO system in a few Japanese oncology practices revealed comprehensive barriers and facilitators. Further efforts are warranted to develop more successful implementation strategies.},

Regulation of Hsp90{$\beta$} is critical to coordinate its tasks and is mediated by several post-translational modifications. Here, we focus on two phosphorylation sites located in the charged linker region of human Hsp90{$\beta$}, Ser226 and Ser255, which have been frequently reported but whose function remains unclear. Targeted measurements by mass spectrometry indicated that intracellular Hsp90{$\beta$} is highly phosphorylated on both sites (\&gt;90\%). The level of phosphorylation was unaffected by various stresses (e.g., heat shock, inhibition with drugs) that impact Hsp90{$\beta$} activity. Mutating the two serines to alanines increased the amount of proteins interacting with Hsp90{$\beta$} globally and increased the sensitivity to tryptic cleavage in the C-terminal domain. Further investigation revealed that phosphorylation on Ser255 and to a lesser extent on Ser226 is decreased in the conditioned medium of cultured K562 cells, and that a non-phosphorylatable double alanine mutant was secreted more efficiently than the wild type. Overall, our results show that phosphorylation events in the charged linker regulate both the interactions of Hsp90{$\beta$} and its secretion, through changes in the conformation of the chaperone.},

Chicken is the most consumed meat both in the United States and across the globe according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Although E. coli is a ubiquitous commensal bacterium of the guts of humans and animals, its ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and virulence factors (VFs) can lead to the emergence of pathogenic strains that are resistant to critically important antibiotics. Thus, it is important to identify the genetic factors that contribute to the virulence and AMR of E. coli. In this study, we performed in-depth genomic evaluation of AMR genes and VFs of E. coli genomes available through the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System GenomeTrackr database. Our objective was to determine the genetic relatedness of chicken production isolates and human clinical isolates. To achieve this aim, we first developed a massively parallel analytical pipeline (Reads2Resistome) to accurately characterize the resistome of each E. coli genome, including the AMR genes and VFs harbored. We used random forests and hierarchical clustering to show that AMR genes and VFs are sufficient to classify isolates into different pathogenic phylogroups and host origin. We found that the presence of key type III secretion system and AMR genes differentiated human clinical isolates from chicken production isolates. These results further improve our understanding of the interconnected role AMR genes and VFs play in shaping the evolution of pathogenic E. coli strains. IMPORTANCE Pathogenic Escherichia coli causes disease in both humans and food-producing animals. E. coli pathogenesis is dependent on a repertoire of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes. Food-borne outbreaks are highly associated with the consumption of undercooked and contaminated food products. This association highlights the need to understand the genetic factors that make E. coli virulent and pathogenic in humans and poultry. This research shows that E. coli isolates originating from human clinical settings and chicken production harbor different antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors that can be used to classify them into phylogroups and host origins. In addition, to aid in the repeatability and reproducibility of the results presented in this study, we have made a public repository of the Reads2Resistome pipeline and have provided the accession numbers associated with the E. coli genomes analyzed.}

  abstract = {It is now indisputable that plastics are ubiquitous and problematic in ecosystems globally. Many suggestions have been made about the role that biofilms colonizing plastics in the environment---termed the ``Plastisphere''---may play in the transportation and ecological impact of these plastics. By collecting and re-analyzing all raw 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metadata from 2,229 samples within 35 studies, we have performed the first meta-analysis of the Plastisphere in marine, freshwater, other aquatic (e.g., brackish or aquaculture) and terrestrial environments. We show that random forest models can be trained to differentiate between groupings of environmental factors as well as aspects of study design, but---crucially---also between plastics when compared with control biofilms and between different plastic types and community successional stages. Our meta-analysis confirms that potentially biodegrading Plastisphere members, the hydrocarbonoclastic Oceanospirillales and Alteromonadales are consistently more abundant in plastic than control biofilm samples across multiple studies and environments. This indicates the predilection of these organisms for plastics and confirms the urgent need for their ability to biodegrade plastics to be comprehensively tested. We also identified key knowledge gaps that should be addressed by future studies.},

  abstract = {Aim Understanding the ecological determinants of interspecific achromatic (light-to-dark) plumage variation in birds is crucial yet challenging due to the complex interplay of climatic, habitat-related, and morphological influences. This study aimed to disentangle the effects of temperature, precipitation, habitat openness, body mass and hand-wing index (HWI, a widely used single-parameter proxy for the extent to which a species relies on flight) on shaping achromatic plumage variation among bird species. Location Global. Time Period Contemporary. Major Taxa Studied Birds. Methods Based on data from over 8000 sessile bird species globally, we employed phylogenetic linear regressions to account for achromatic plumage colour in relation to temperature, precipitation, habitat openness, body mass and HWI, while correcting for phylogenetic non-independence between species. Furthermore, we conducted phylogenetic path analyses to decompose direct from indirect effects. Results We found that temperature, precipitation, habitat openness and body mass exerted separate but interactive effects on the variation in achromatic colour across species. Species inhabiting cold, wet or densely vegetated environments were darker coloured, while smaller species were lighter. Darker plumage was more strongly related to higher precipitation in colder regions for nocturnal species. For diurnal species, darker plumage was more closely associated with higher precipitation in more open habitats, whereas lighter plumage was more linked to lower mass in denser habitats. Noteworthy was the identification of a substantial correlation between achromatic colour and HWI. Diurnal species that are more aerial were lighter. Conversely, nocturnal flyers, especially females, tended to be darker. Main Conclusions The findings highlight the multifaceted nature of plumage coloration evolution, with adaptations for thermal efficiency, crypsis, signalling, waterproofing or protection against bacteria. However, the variable relative importance of these factors among groups emphasizes the significance of each factor in different contexts.},

Our results indicate that, consistent with the Jarman-Bell principle relating body size to fibre intake and feeding selectivity, juvenile hadrosaurids were relatively more selective than their adult counterparts and subsisted on softer, low-growing browse cropped using lateral rotations of the neck. Chewing movements of the jaw probably did not differ greatly between growth stages.

  abstract = {As a newly identified type of programmed cell death, cuproptosis may have an impact on cancer development, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Herein, we first noticed that the expression levels of cuproptosis regulators exhibited a tight correlation with the clinicopathological characteristics of ccRCC. The cuproptosis-sensitive sub-type (CSS), classified via consensus clustering analysis, harbored a higher overall survival rate compared to the cuproptosis-resistant sub-type (CRS), which may have resulted from the differential infiltration of immune cells. FDX1, the cuproptosis master regulator, was experimentally determined as a tumor suppressor in ccRCC cells by suppressing the cell growth and cell invasion of ACHN and OSRC-2 cells in a cuproptosis-dependent and -independent manner. The results from IHC staining also demonstrated that FDX1 expression was negatively correlated with ccRCC tumor initiation and progression. Furthermore, we identified the miR-21-5p/FDX1 axis in ccRCC and experimentally verified that miR-21-5p directly binds the 3'-UTR of FDX1 to mediate its degradation. Consequently, a miR-21-5p inhibitor suppressed the cell growth and cell invasion of ACHN and OSRC-2 cells, which could be compensated by FDX1 knockdown, reinforcing the functional linkage between miR-21-5p and FDX1 in ccRCC. Finally, we evaluated the ccRCC tumor microenvironment under the miR-21-5p/FDX1 axis and noted that this axis was strongly associated with the infiltration of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, Treg cells, and macrophages, suggesting that this signaling axis may alter microenvironmental components to drive ccRCC progression. Overall, this study constructed the miR-21-5p/FDX1 axis in ccRCC and analyzed its potential impact on the tumor microenvironment, providing valuable insights to improve current ccRCC management.},

  abstract = {A fundamental interest in developmental neuroscience lies in the ability to map the complete single-cell lineages within the brain. To this end, we developed a CRISPR editing-based lineage-specific tracing (CREST) method for clonal tracing in Cre mice. We then used two complementary strategies based on CREST to map single-cell lineages in developing mouse ventral midbrain (vMB). By applying snapshotting CREST (snapCREST), we constructed a spatiotemporal lineage landscape of developing vMB and identified six progenitor archetypes that could represent the principal clonal fates of individual vMB progenitors and three distinct clonal lineages in the floor plate that specified glutamatergic, dopaminergic or both neurons. We further created pandaCREST (progenitor and derivative associating CREST) to associate the transcriptomes of progenitor cells in vivo with their differentiation potentials. We identified multiple origins of dopaminergic neurons and demonstrated that a transcriptome-defined progenitor type comprises heterogeneous progenitors, each with distinct clonal fates and molecular signatures. Therefore, the CREST method and strategies allow comprehensive single-cell lineage analysis that could offer new insights into the molecular programs underlying neural specification.},

This study examined global gradients in the relative lengths of bird bills and tarsi (i.e. exposed leg parts) to body size across non-migratory birds, while accounting for phylogeny. We found that relative bill length and tarsus length were related to diet, habitat density, latitude, annual mean temperature, temperature variability and hand--wing index (HWI), a proxy for birds' flight efficiency. Among these factors, diet played a primary role in predicting bill length, with nectar-feeding pollinators, vertivores, invertivores and omnivores having longer bills; HWI emerged as the predominant predictor of tarsus length, wherein species with higher HWI had shorter tarsi. However, the effects of these factors differed between passerines and non-passerines, with some temperature-related effects exhibiting opposite trends between these two groups. Our findings highlight the compromise in adaptations for feeding, thermoregulation and flight performance between the two distinct appendages.},

Many case studies and literature reviews have been published on the subject. However, an updated and global-level synthesis on the effect of SNS on biodiversity conservation is still lacking. Here, we provide the first systematic review on SNS and biodiversity conservation, aiming to evaluate the effect of SNS across different: (i) continents; (ii) taxa; (iii) metrics. We checked 2750 papers and by applying inclusion criteria we selected 27 relevant papers. From these, we extracted descriptive data and 131 comparisons between SNS and Reference Sites. We applied vote-counting, multinomial and binomial post-hoc tests to the 131 comparisons. We found strong evidence that SNS have a positive effect on biodiversity, but also strong geographical and taxonomical biases, with most research focusing on Asia and Africa and on plants. We found that SNS have mainly positive effects on taxonomical diversity, vegetation structure and cultural uses of biodiversity. Our results strongly support the view that SNS have positive effects on biodiversity across continents and geographical settings, as found in a number of local studies and earlier overviews. These effects should be given official recognition in appropriate conservation frameworks, together with the specific forms of governance and management that characterize SNS. At the same time, further efforts are also required to fill the geographical and taxonomical gaps here highlighted, and to advancing our knowledge of SNS through more systematic research.},

The bioactive substances and potential targets of each component of RJP were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the monkeypox virus (MPXV) were identified from the GSE24125 by GEO2R.

Finally, molecular docking was used to predict the interaction between active compounds and core targets. A total of 158 active ingredients and 17 drug-disease-shared targets of RJP were screened. Bioinformatics indicated that wogonin and quercetin might be potential drug candidates. Potential therapeutic targets were identified. Immune-related mechanisms that exerted antiviral effects included signaling pathways like TNF, age-rage, and c-type lectin receptor pathways. Our results illustrated the good therapeutic effect of RJP on monkeypox in terms of biological activity, potential targets, and molecular mechanism.
