  abstract = {Warming-induced permafrost thaw could enhance microbial decomposition of previously stored soil organic matter (SOM) to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. The environmental parameters regulating microbe-organic matter interactions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in permafrost peatlands are however still largely unknown. The objective of this work is to understand controls on SOM degradation and its impact on GHG emissions across the Stordalen Mire, a thawing peat plateau in Northern Sweden. Here, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize SOM molecular composition in peat soil samples from the active layers of a Sphagnum-dominated bog and rich fen sites in the Mire. Microbe-organic matter interactions and GHG emissions across the thaw gradient were controlled by aboveground vegetation and soil pH. An increasingly high abundance of reduced organic compounds experiencing greater humification rates due to enhanced microbial activity were observed with increasing thaw, in parallel with higher CH4 and CO2 emissions. Bog SOM however contained more Sphagnum-derived phenolics, simple carbohydrates, and organic- acids. The low degradation of bog SOM by microbial communities, the enhanced SOM transformation by potentially abiotic mechanisms, and the accumulation of simple carbohydrates in the bog sites could be attributed in part to the low pH conditions of the system associated with Sphagnum mosses. We show that Gibbs free energy of C half reactions based on C oxidation state for OM can be used as a quantifiable measure for OM decomposability and quality to enhance current biogeochemical models to predict C decomposition rates. We found a direct association between OM chemical diversity and {$\delta$}13C-CH4 in peat porewater; where higher substrate diversity was positively correlated with enriched {$\delta$}13C-CH4 in fen sites. Oxidized sulfur-containing compounds, produced by Sphagnum, were further hypothesized to control GHG emissions by acting as electron acceptors for a sulfate-reducing electron transport chain, inhibiting methanogenesis in peat bogs. These results suggest that warming-induced permafrost thaw might increase organic matter lability, in subset of sites that become wetlands, and shift biogeochemical processes toward faster decomposition with an increasing proportion of Creleased as CH4.},

But children who have undergone a hemispherectomy develop with only one hemisphere. The question is whether this preserved hemisphere, be it left or right, can support both word and face recognition. Here, a large sample of patients with childhood hemispherectomy and age-matched controls performed word- and face-matching tasks. Controls viewed stimuli either in one visual field (restricting initial processing to one hemisphere) or, like the patients, in central vision. Across word and face tasks, patients performed comparably to controls using primarily one hemisphere, but more poorly than controls viewing stimuli centrally with both hemispheres engaged. Additionally, patients showed deficits in low-level visual processing that may explain their word/face recognition deficits relative to controls. Altogether, the findings suggest that either hemisphere alone can support word and face recognition, albeit sub-optimally.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

By jointly analyzing mutant and wild-type cells we decomposed our data into 46 components that identify novel meiotic gene-regulatory programs, mutant-specific pathological processes, and technical effects, and provide a framework for imputation. We identify, de novo, DNA sequence motifs associated with individual components that define temporally varying modes of gene expression control. Analysis of SDA components also led us to identify a rare population of macrophages within the seminiferous tubules of Mlh3-/- and Hormad1-/- mice, an area typically associated with immune privilege.},

Studies have constructed the genetic polymorphism spectrum of Han Chinese, whereas high-resolution investigations are still missing to unveil its fine-scale substructure and trace the genetic imprints for its demographic history. Here we construct a haplotype network consisted of 111,000 genome-wide genotyped Han Chinese individuals from direct-to-consumer genetic testing and over 1.3 billion identity-by-descent (IBD) links. We observed a clear separation of the northern and southern Han Chinese and captured 5 subclusters and 17 sub-subclusters in haplotype network hierarchical clustering, corresponding to geography (especially mountain ranges), immigration waves, and clans with cultural-linguistic segregation. We inferred differentiated split histories and founder effects for population clans Cantonese, Hakka, and Minnan-Chaoshanese in southern China, and also unveiled more recent demographic events within the past few centuries, such as \emph{Zou Xikou} and \emph{Chuang Guandong}. The composition shifts of the native and current residents of four major metropolitans (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) imply a rapidly vanished genetic barrier between subpopulations. Our study yields a fine-scale population structure of Han Chinese and provides profound insights into the nation's genetic and cultural-linguistic multiformity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Germinal centers play a key role in the adaptive immune system since they are able to produce memory B cells and plasma cells that produce high affinity antibodies for an effective immune protection. The mechanisms underlying cell-fate decisions are not well understood but asymmetric division of antigen, B-cell receptor affinity, interactions between B-cells and T follicular helper cells (triggering CD40 signaling), and regulatory interactions of transcription factors have all been proposed to play a role. In addition, a temporal switch from memory B-cell to plasma cell differentiation during the germinal center reaction has been shown. To investigate if antigen affinity-based Tfh cell help recapitulates the temporal switch we implemented a multiscale model that integrates cellular interactions with a core gene regulatory network comprising BCL6, IRF4, and BLIMP1. Using this model we show that affinity-based CD40 signaling in combination with asymmetric division of B-cells result in switch from memory B-cell to plasma cell generation during the course of the germinal center reaction. We also show that cell fate division is unlikely to be (solely) based on asymmetric division of Ag but that BLIMP1 is a more important factor. Altogether, our model enables to test the influence of molecular modulations of the CD40 signaling pathway on the production of germinal center output cells.},

  abstract = {Hydroclimatic time series analysis focuses on a few feature types (e.g., autocorrelations, trends, extremes), which describe a small portion of the entire information content of the observations. Aiming to exploit a larger part of the available information and, thus, to deliver more reliable results (e.g., in hydroclimatic time series clustering contexts), here we approach hydroclimatic time series analysis differently, i.e., by performing massive feature extraction. In this respect, we develop a big data framework for hydroclimatic variable behaviour characterization. This framework relies on approximately 60 diverse features and is completely automatic (in the sense that it does not depend on the hydroclimatic process at hand). We apply the new framework to characterize mean monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and mean monthly river flow. The applications are conducted at the global scale by exploiting 40-year-long time series originating from over 13 000 stations. We extract interpretable knowledge on seasonality, trends, autocorrelation, long-range dependence and entropy, and on feature types that are met less frequently. We further compare the examined hydroclimatic variable types in terms of this knowledge and, identify patterns related to the spatial variability of the features. For this latter purpose, we also propose and exploit a hydroclimatic time series clustering methodology. This new methodology is based on Breiman's random forests. The descriptive and exploratory insights gained by the global-scale applications prove the usefulness of the adopted feature compilation in hydroclimatic contexts. Moreover, the spatially coherent patterns characterizing the clusters delivered by the new methodology build confidence in its future exploitation. Given this spatial coherence and the scale-independent nature of the delivered feature values (which makes them particularly useful in forecasting and simulation contexts), we believe that this methodology could also be beneficial within regionalization frameworks, in which knowledge on hydrological similarity is exploited in technical and operative terms.},

Those pairs allow the identification of distinct molecular structures found as components of heterogeneous chemical matrices originating from living organisms. Current databases with such information suffer from paywall restrictions, limited taxonomic scope, poorly standardized fields, and lack of interoperability. To ensure data quality, references to the work that describes the structure-organism relationship are mandatory.

All the programs developed for data collection, curation, and dissemination are publicly available. To provide unlimited access as well as standardized linking to other resources, LOTUS data is both hosted on Wikidata and regularly mirrored on https://lotus.naturalproducts.net. The diffusion of these referenced structure-organism pairs within the Wikidata framework addresses many of the limitations of currently-available databases and facilitates linkage to existing biological and chemical data resources.

We hypothesize that peptide vaccines containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell stimulation would drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity, potentially avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we propose a set of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies and clinical trials.,},
